https://github.com/redis/go-redis/commit/d236865b0cfa1b752ea4b7da666b1fdcd0acebb6,CWE-20,CVE-2025-29923,UNKNOWN,N/A,"go-redis is the official Redis client library for the Go programming language. Prior to 9.5.5, 9.6.3, and 9.7.3, go-redis potentially responds out of order when `CLIENT SETINFO` times out during connection establishment. This can happen when the client is configured to transmit its identity, there are network connectivity issues, or the client was configured with aggressive timeouts. The problem occurs for multiple use cases. For sticky connections, you receive persistent out-of-order responses for the lifetime of the connection. All commands in the pipeline receive incorrect responses. When used with the default ConnPool once a connection is returned after use with ConnPool#Put the read buffer will be checked and the connection will be marked as bad due to the unread data. This means that at most one out-of-order response before the connection is discarded. This issue is fixed in 9.5.5, 9.6.3, and 9.7.3. You can prevent the vulnerability by setting the flag DisableIndentity to true when constructing the client instance."

Versions 3.2.8-bugfix and prior are vulnerable to denial of service (DoS) in restart.py. `model_name` in train.py takes user input, and passes it to the `stop_train` function in restart.py, which uses it construct a path to a folder with `config.json`. That `config.json` is opened and the list of values under ""process_pids"" are read. Next all the process IDs listed in the JSON are killed. Using one of the arbitrary file writes, one can  write to `logs/foobar` a `config.json` file, which contains a list of process IDs. Then one can access this endpoint to kill these processes. Since an attacker can't know what process is running on which process ID, they can send a list of hundreds of process IDs, which can kill the process that applio is using to run, as well as other, potentially important processes, which leads to DoS. Note that constructing a path with user input also enables path traversal.

Prior to 5.0.6, the fast-jwt library does not properly validate the iss claim based on the RFC 7519. The iss (issuer) claim validation within the fast-jwt library permits an array of strings as a valid iss value. This design flaw enables a potential attack where a malicious actor crafts a JWT with an iss claim structured as ['https://attacker-domain/', 'https://valid-iss']. Due to the permissive validation, the JWT will be deemed valid. Furthermore, if the application relies on external libraries like get-jwks that do not independently validate the iss claim, the attacker can leverage this vulnerability to forge a JWT that will be accepted by the victim application. Essentially, the attacker can insert their own domain into the iss array, alongside the legitimate issuer, and bypass the intended security checks. This issue is fixed in 5.0.6."

The vulnerability lies in the function `Crypto_TC_Prep_AAD`, specifically during the computation of `tc_mac_start_index`. The affected code incorrectly calculates the MAC start index without ensuring it remains within the bounds of the `ingest` buffer. When `tc_mac_start_index` underflows due to an incorrect length calculation, the function attempts to access an out-of-bounds memory location, leading to a segmentation fault. The vulnerability is still present in the repository as of commit `d3cc420ace96d02a5b7e83d88cbd2e48010d5723`."
https://github.com/nasa/CryptoLib/commit/ca39cb96f21e76102aefb956d2c8c0ba0bd143ca,CWE-191,CVE-2025-29912,UNKNOWN,N/A,"CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. In versions 1.3.3 and prior, an unsigned integer underflow in the `Crypto_TC_ProcessSecurity` function of CryptoLib leads to a heap buffer overflow. The vulnerability is triggered when the `fl` (frame length) field in a Telecommand (TC) packet is set to 0. This underflow causes the frame length to be interpreted as 65535, resulting in out-of-bounds memory access. This critical vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS) or potentially achieve remote code execution. Users of CryptoLib are advised to apply the recommended patch or avoid processing untrusted TC packets until a fix is available."

Baremetal Operator enables users to load Secret from arbitrary namespaces upon deployment of the namespace scoped Custom Resource `BMCEventSubscription`. Prior to versions 0.8.1 and 0.9.1, an adversary Kubernetes account with only namespace level roles (e.g. a tenant controlling a namespace) may create a `BMCEventSubscription` in his authorized namespace and then load Secrets from his unauthorized namespaces to his authorized namespace via the Baremetal Operator, causing Secret Leakage. The patch makes BMO refuse to read Secrets from other namespace than where the corresponding BMH resource is. The patch does not change the `BMCEventSubscription` API in BMO, but stricter validation will fail the request at admission time. It will also prevent the controller reading such Secrets, in case the BMCES CR has already been deployed. The issue exists for all versions of BMO, and is patched in BMO releases v0.9.1 and v0.8.1. Prior upgrading to patched BMO version, duplicate any existing Secret pointed to by `BMCEventSubscription`'s `httpHeadersRef` to the same namespace where the corresponding BMH exists. After upgrade, remove the old Secrets. As a workaround, the operator can configure BMO RBAC to be namespace scoped, instead of cluster scoped, to prevent BMO from accessing Secrets from other namespaces, and/or use `WATCH_NAMESPACE` configuration option to limit BMO to single namespace."

Zincati ships a polkit rule which allows the `zincati` system user to use the actions `org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.deploy` to deploy updates to the system and `org.projectatomic.rpmostree1.finalize-deployment` to reboot the system into the deployed update. Since Zincati v0.0.24, this polkit rule contains a logic error which broadens access of those polkit actions to any unprivileged user rather than just the `zincati` system user. In practice, this means that any unprivileged user with access to the system D-Bus socket is able to deploy older Fedora CoreOS versions (which may have other known vulnerabilities). Note that rpm-ostree enforces that the selected version must be from the same branch the system is currently on so this cannot directly be used to deploy an attacker-controlled update payload. This primarily impacts users running untrusted workloads with access to the system D-Bus socket. Note that in general, untrusted workloads should not be given this access, whether containerized or not. By default, containers do not have access to the system D-Bus socket. The logic error is fixed in Zincati v0.0.30. A workaround is to manually add a following polkit rule, instructions for which are available in the GitHub Security Advisory."

A vulnerability in versions prior to 1.6.1, 1.7.1, and 2.0.1 allows users to manipulate the final payment amount processed by PayPal. If a user modifies the item quantity in their shopping cart after initiating the PayPal Express Checkout process, PayPal will not receive the updated total amount. As a result, PayPal captures only the initially transmitted amount, while Sylius incorrectly considers the order fully paid based on the modified total. This flaw can be exploited both accidentally and intentionally, potentially enabling fraud by allowing customers to pay less than the actual order value. Attackers can intentionally pay less than the actual total order amount, business owners may suffer financial losses due to underpaid orders, and integrity of payment processing is compromised. The issue is fixed in versions 1.6.1, 1.7.1, 2.0.1, and above. To resolve the problem in the end application without updating to the newest patches, there is a need to overwrite `ProcessPayPalOrderAction`, `CompletePayPalOrderFromPaymentPageAction`, and `CaptureAction` with modified logic."

https://github.com/expr-lang/expr/pull/762,CWE-770,CVE-2025-29786,UNKNOWN,N/A,"Expr is an expression language and expression evaluation for Go. Prior to version 1.17.0, if the Expr expression parser is given an unbounded input string, it will attempt to compile the entire string and generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node for each part of the expression. In scenarios where input size isn’t limited, a malicious or inadvertent extremely large expression can consume excessive memory as the parser builds a huge AST. This can ultimately lead to*excessive memory usage and an Out-Of-Memory (OOM) crash of the process. This issue is relatively uncommon and will only manifest when there are no restrictions on the input size, i.e. the expression length is allowed to grow arbitrarily large. In typical use cases where inputs are bounded or validated, this problem would not occur. The problem has been patched in the latest versions of the Expr library. The fix introduces compile-time limits on the number of AST nodes and memory usage during parsing, preventing any single expression from exhausting resources. Users should upgrade to Expr version 1.17.0 or later, as this release includes the new node budget and memory limit safeguards. Upgrading to v1.17.0 ensures that extremely deep or large expressions are detected and safely aborted during compilation, avoiding the OOM condition. For users who cannot immediately upgrade, the recommended workaround is to impose an input size restriction before parsing. In practice, this means validating or limiting the length of expression strings that your application will accept. For example, set a maximum allowable number of characters (or nodes) for any expression and reject or truncate inputs that exceed this limit. By ensuring no unbounded-length expression is ever fed into the parser, one can prevent the parser from constructing a pathologically large AST and avoid potential memory exhaustion. In short, pre-validate and cap input size as a safeguard in the absence of the patch."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack,N/A,CVE-2025-29780,UNKNOWN,N/A,"Post-Quantum Secure Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing provides a Python implementation of Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme. In versions 0.8.0b2 and prior, the `feldman_vss` library contains timing side-channel vulnerabilities in its matrix operations, specifically within the `_find_secure_pivot` function and potentially other parts of `_secure_matrix_solve`. These vulnerabilities are due to Python's execution model, which does not guarantee constant-time execution. An attacker with the ability to measure the execution time of these functions (e.g., through repeated calls with carefully crafted inputs) could potentially recover secret information used in the Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme. The `_find_secure_pivot` function, used during Gaussian elimination in `_secure_matrix_solve`, attempts to find a non-zero pivot element. However, the conditional statement `if matrix[row][col] != 0 and row_random < min_value:` has execution time that depends on the value of `matrix[row][col]`. This timing difference can be exploited by an attacker. The `constant_time_compare` function in this file also does not provide a constant-time guarantee. The Python implementation of matrix operations in the _find_secure_pivot and _secure_matrix_solve functions cannot guarantee constant-time execution, potentially leaking information about secret polynomial coefficients. An attacker with the ability to make precise timing measurements of these operations could potentially extract secret information through statistical analysis of execution times, though practical exploitation would require significant expertise and controlled execution environments. Successful exploitation of these timing side-channels could allow an attacker to recover secret keys or other sensitive information protected by the VSS scheme. This could lead to a complete compromise of the shared secret. As of time of publication, no patched versions of Post-Quantum Secure Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing exist, but other mitigations are available. As acknowledged in the library's documentation, these vulnerabilities cannot be adequately addressed in pure Python. In the short term, consider using this library only in environments where timing measurements by attackers are infeasible. In the medium term, implement your own wrappers around critical operations using constant-time libraries in languages like Rust, Go, or C. In the long term, wait for the planned Rust implementation mentioned in the library documentation that will properly address these issues."
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_attack,N/A,CVE-2025-29779,UNKNOWN,N/A,"Post-Quantum Secure Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing provides a Python implementation of Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme. In versions 0.8.0b2 and prior, the `secure_redundant_execution` function in feldman_vss.py attempts to mitigate fault injection attacks by executing a function multiple times and comparing results. However, several critical weaknesses exist. Python's execution environment cannot guarantee true isolation between redundant executions, the constant-time comparison implementation in Python is subject to timing variations, the randomized execution order and timing provide insufficient protection against sophisticated fault attacks, and the error handling may leak timing information about partial execution results. These limitations make the protection ineffective against targeted fault injection attacks, especially from attackers with physical access to the hardware. A successful fault injection attack could allow an attacker to bypass the redundancy check mechanisms, extract secret polynomial coefficients during share generation or verification, force the acceptance of invalid shares during verification, and/or manipulate the commitment verification process to accept fraudulent commitments. This undermines the core security guarantees of the Verifiable Secret Sharing scheme. As of time of publication, no patched versions of Post-Quantum Secure Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing exist, but other mitigations are available. Long-term remediation requires reimplementing the security-critical functions in a lower-level language like Rust. Short-term mitigations include deploying the software in environments with physical security controls, increasing the redundancy count (from 5 to a higher number) by modifying the source code, adding external verification of cryptographic operations when possible, considering using hardware security modules (HSMs) for key operations."

This issue affects Apache Camel: from 4.10.0 before 4.10.2, from 4.8.0 before 4.8.5, from 3.10.0 before 3.22.4.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.10.2 for 4.10.x LTS, 4.8.5 for 4.8.x LTS and 3.22.4 for 3.x releases.

This vulnerability is present in Camel's default incoming header filter, that allows an attacker to include Camel specific headers that for some Camel components can alter the behaviours such as the camel-bean component, or the camel-exec component.

If you have Camel applications that are directly connected to the internet via HTTP, then an attacker could include parameters in the HTTP requests that are sent to the Camel application that get translated into headers. 

The headers could be both provided as request parameters for an HTTP methods invocation or as part of the payload of the HTTP methods invocation.

All the known Camel HTTP component such as camel-servlet, camel-jetty, camel-undertow, camel-platform-http, and camel-netty-http would be vulnerable out of the box.

This CVE is related to the CVE-2025-27636: while they have the same root cause and are fixed with the same fix, CVE-2025-27636 was assumed to only be exploitable if an attacker could add malicious HTTP headers, while we have now determined that it is also exploitable via HTTP parameters.

  ==================================================================

f8 corresponds to KASAN_VMALLOC_INVALID which means the area is not
initialised hence not supposed to be used yet.

Powerpc text patching infrastructure allocates a virtual memory area
using get_vm_area() and flags it as VM_ALLOC. But that flag is meant
to be used for vmalloc() and vmalloc() allocated memory is not
supposed to be used before a call to __vmalloc_node_range() which is
never called for that area.

That went undetected until commit e4137f08816b (""mm, kasan, kmsan:
instrument copy_from/to_kernel_nofault"")

The area allocated by text_area_cpu_up() is not vmalloc memory, it is
mapped directly on demand when needed by map_kernel_page(). There is
no VM flag corresponding to such usage, so just pass no flag. That way
the area will be unpoisonned and usable immediately."
https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/33eb925c0c26e86ca540a08254806512bf911f22,CWE-787,CVE-2025-21865,MEDIUM,5.5,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

gtp: Suppress list corruption splat in gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl().

Brad Spengler reported the list_del() corruption splat in
gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl(). [0]

Commit eb28fd76c0a0 (""gtp: Destroy device along with udp socket's netns
dismantle."") added the for_each_netdev() loop in gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl()
to destroy devices in each netns as done in geneve and ip tunnels.

However, this could trigger ->dellink() twice for the same device during
->exit_batch_rtnl().

Say we have two netns A & B and gtp device B that resides in netns B but
whose UDP socket is in netns A.

  1. cleanup_net() processes netns A and then B.

  2. gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl() finds the device B while iterating
     netns A's gn->gtp_dev_list and calls ->dellink().

  [ device B is not yet unlinked from netns B
    as unregister_netdevice_many() has not been called. ]

  3. gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl() finds the device B while iterating
     netns B's for_each_netdev() and calls ->dellink().

gtp_dellink() cleans up the device's hash table, unlinks the dev from
gn->gtp_dev_list, and calls unregister_netdevice_queue().

Basically, calling gtp_dellink() multiple times is fine unless
CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST is enabled.

Let's remove for_each_netdev() in gtp_net_exit_batch_rtnl() and
delegate the destruction to default_device_exit_batch() as done
in bareudp.

tcp: drop secpath at the same time as we currently drop dst

Xiumei reported hitting the WARN in xfrm6_tunnel_net_exit while
running tests that boil down to:
 - create a pair of netns
 - run a basic TCP test over ipcomp6
 - delete the pair of netns

The xfrm_state found on spi_byaddr was not deleted at the time we
delete the netns, because we still have a reference on it. This
lingering reference comes from a secpath (which holds a ref on the
xfrm_state), which is still attached to an skb. This skb is not
leaked, it ends up on sk_receive_queue and then gets defer-free'd by
skb_attempt_defer_free.

The problem happens when we defer freeing an skb (push it on one CPU's
defer_list), and don't flush that list before the netns is deleted. In
that case, we still have a reference on the xfrm_state that we don't
expect at this point.

We already drop the skb's dst in the TCP receive path when it's no
longer needed, so let's also drop the secpath. At this point,
tcp_filter has already called into the LSM hooks that may require the
secpath, so it should not be needed anymore. However, in some of those
places, the MPTCP extension has just been attached to the skb, so we
cannot simply drop all extensions."

If drop_monitor is built as a kernel module, syzkaller may have time
to send a netlink NET_DM_CMD_START message during the module loading.
This will call the net_dm_monitor_start() function that uses
a spinlock that has not yet been initialized.

To fix this, let's place resource initialization above the registration
of a generic netlink family.

mm/migrate_device: don't add folio to be freed to LRU in migrate_device_finalize()

If migration succeeded, we called
folio_migrate_flags()->mem_cgroup_migrate() to migrate the memcg from the
old to the new folio.  This will set memcg_data of the old folio to 0.

Similarly, if migration failed, memcg_data of the dst folio is left unset.

If we call folio_putback_lru() on such folios (memcg_data == 0), we will
add the folio to be freed to the LRU, making memcg code unhappy.  Running

Likely, nothing else goes wrong: putting the last folio reference will
remove the folio from the LRU again.  So besides memcg complaining, adding
the folio to be freed to the LRU is just an unnecessary step.

The new flow resembles what we have in migrate_folio_move(): add the dst

mm/zswap: fix inconsistency when zswap_store_page() fails

Commit b7c0ccdfbafd (""mm: zswap: support large folios in zswap_store()"")
skips charging any zswap entries when it failed to zswap the entire folio.

However, when some base pages are zswapped but it failed to zswap the
entire folio, the zswap operation is rolled back.  When freeing zswap
entries for those pages, zswap_entry_free() uncharges the zswap entries
that were not previously charged, causing zswap charging to become
inconsistent.

This inconsistency triggers two warnings with following steps:
  # On a machine with 64GiB of RAM and 36GiB of zswap
  $ stress-ng --bigheap 2 # wait until the OOM-killer kills stress-ng
  $ sudo reboot

  The two warnings are:
    in mm/memcontrol.c:163, function obj_cgroup_release():
      WARN_ON_ONCE(nr_bytes & (PAGE_SIZE - 1));

    in mm/page_counter.c:60, function page_counter_cancel():
      if (WARN_ONCE(new < 0, ""page_counter underflow: %ld nr_pages=%lu\n"",
	  new, nr_pages))

zswap_stored_pages also becomes inconsistent in the same way.

As suggested by Kanchana, increment zswap_stored_pages and charge zswap
entries within zswap_store_page() when it succeeds.  This way,
zswap_entry_free() will decrement the counter and uncharge the entries
when it failed to zswap the entire folio.

While this could potentially be optimized by batching objcg charging and
incrementing the counter, let's focus on fixing the bug this time and
leave the optimization for later after some evaluation.

After resolving the inconsistency, the warnings disappear.

geneve: Fix use-after-free in geneve_find_dev().

syzkaller reported a use-after-free in geneve_find_dev() [0]
without repro.

geneve_configure() links struct geneve_dev.next to
net_generic(net, geneve_net_id)->geneve_list.

The net here could differ from dev_net(dev) if IFLA_NET_NS_PID,
IFLA_NET_NS_FD, or IFLA_TARGET_NETNSID is set.

When dev_net(dev) is dismantled, geneve_exit_batch_rtnl() finally
calls unregister_netdevice_queue() for each dev in the netns,
and later the dev is freed.

However, its geneve_dev.next is still linked to the backend UDP
socket netns.

Then, use-after-free will occur when another geneve dev is created
in the netns.

Let's call geneve_dellink() instead in geneve_destroy_tunnels().

sockmap, vsock: For connectible sockets allow only connected

sockmap expects all vsocks to have a transport assigned, which is expressed
in vsock_proto::psock_update_sk_prot(). However, there is an edge case
where an unconnected (connectible) socket may lose its previously assigned
transport. This is handled with a NULL check in the vsock/BPF recv path.

Another design detail is that listening vsocks are not supposed to have any
transport assigned at all. Which implies they are not supported by the
sockmap. But this is complicated by the fact that a socket, before
switching to TCP_LISTEN, may have had some transport assigned during a
failed connect() attempt. Hence, we may end up with a listening vsock in a
sockmap, which blows up quickly:

bpf: avoid holding freeze_mutex during mmap operation

We use map->freeze_mutex to prevent races between map_freeze() and
memory mapping BPF map contents with writable permissions. The way we
naively do this means we'll hold freeze_mutex for entire duration of all
the mm and VMA manipulations, which is completely unnecessary. This can
potentially also lead to deadlocks, as reported by syzbot in [0].

So, instead, hold freeze_mutex only during writeability checks, bump
(proactively) ""write active"" count for the map, unlock the mutex and
proceed with mmap logic. And only if something went wrong during mmap
logic, then undo that ""write active"" counter increment.

net: Add rx_skb of kfree_skb to raw_tp_null_args[].

Yan Zhai reported a BPF prog could trigger a null-ptr-deref [0]

Commit c53795d48ee8 (""net: add rx_sk to trace_kfree_skb"") added
rx_sk to trace_kfree_skb, but rx_sk is optional and could be NULL.

Let's add kfree_skb to raw_tp_null_args[] to let the BPF verifier
validate such a prog and prevent the issue.

Now we fail to load such a prog:

It turns out arena_map_free() is calling

acct: perform last write from workqueue

In [1] it was reported that the acct(2) system call can be used to
trigger NULL deref in cases where it is set to write to a file that
triggers an internal lookup. This can e.g., happen when pointing acc(2)
to /sys/power/resume. At the point the where the write to this file
happens the calling task has already exited and called exit_fs(). A
lookup will thus trigger a NULL-deref when accessing current->fs.

Reorganize the code so that the the final write happens from the
workqueue but with the caller's credentials. This preserves the
(strange) permission model and has almost no regression risk.

This api should stop to exist though."

Later bpf_cgrp_storage was first introduced in
c4bcfb38a95e (""bpf: Implement cgroup storage available to non-cgroup-attached bpf progs"")
which faces the same issue as bpf_task_storage, instead of its busy
counter, NULL was passed to bpf_local_storage_map_free() which opened
a window to cause deadlock:

Progs:
 - A: SEC(""fentry/cgroup_storage_ptr"")
   - cgid (BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH)
	Record the id of the cgroup the current task belonging
	to in this hash map, using the address of the cgroup
	as the map key.
   - cgrpa (BPF_MAP_TYPE_CGRP_STORAGE)
	If current task is a kworker, lookup the above hash
	map using function parameter @owner as the key to get
	its corresponding cgroup id which is then used to get
	a trusted pointer to the cgroup through
	bpf_cgroup_from_id(). This trusted pointer can then
	be passed to bpf_cgrp_storage_get() to finally trigger
	the deadlock issue.
 - B: SEC(""tp_btf/sys_enter"")
   - cgrpb (BPF_MAP_TYPE_CGRP_STORAGE)
	The only purpose of this prog is to fill Prog A's
	hash map by calling bpf_cgrp_storage_get() for as
	many userspace tasks as possible.

Steps to reproduce:
 - Run A;
 - while (true) { Run B; Destroy B; }

Fix this issue by passing its busy counter to the free procedure so
it can be properly incremented before storage/smap locking."

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/09/1,N/A,CVE-2025-27636,UNKNOWN,N/A,"Bypass/Injection vulnerability in Apache Camel components under particular conditions.

This issue affects Apache Camel: from 4.10.0 through <= 4.10.1, from 4.8.0 through <= 4.8.4, from 3.10.0 through <= 3.22.3.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.10.2 for 4.10.x LTS, 4.8.5 for 4.8.x LTS and 3.22.4 for 3.x releases.



This vulnerability is present in Camel's default incoming header filter, that allows an attacker to include Camel specific

headers that for some Camel components can alter the behaviours such as the camel-bean component, to call another method

on the bean, than was coded in the application. In the camel-jms component, then a malicious header can be used to send

the message to another queue (on the same broker) than was coded in the application. This could also be seen by using the camel-exec component




The attacker would need to inject custom headers, such as HTTP protocols. So if you have Camel applications that are

directly connected to the internet via HTTP, then an attacker could include malicious HTTP headers in the HTTP requests

that are send to the Camel application.




All the known Camel HTTP component such as camel-servlet, camel-jetty, camel-undertow, camel-platform-http, and camel-netty-http would be vulnerable out of the box.

In these conditions an attacker could be able to forge a Camel header name and make the bean component invoking other methods in the same bean.

In terms of usage of the default header filter strategy the list of components using that is: 


  *  camel-activemq
  *  camel-activemq6
  *  camel-amqp
  *  camel-aws2-sqs
  *  camel-azure-servicebus
  *  camel-cxf-rest
  *  camel-cxf-soap
  *  camel-http
  *  camel-jetty
  *  camel-jms
  *  camel-kafka
  *  camel-knative
  *  camel-mail
  *  camel-nats
  *  camel-netty-http
  *  camel-platform-http
  *  camel-rest
  *  camel-sjms
  *  camel-spring-rabbitmq
  *  camel-stomp
  *  camel-tahu
  *  camel-undertow
  *  camel-xmpp






The vulnerability arises due to a bug in the default filtering mechanism that only blocks headers starting with ""Camel"", ""camel"", or ""org.apache.camel."". 


Mitigation: You can easily work around this in your Camel applications by removing the headers in your Camel routes. There are many ways of doing this, also globally or per route. This means you could use the removeHeaders EIP, to filter out anything like ""cAmel, cAMEL"" etc, or in general everything not starting with ""Camel"", ""camel"" or ""org.apache.camel.""."

KVM: Explicitly verify target vCPU is online in kvm_get_vcpu()

Explicitly verify the target vCPU is fully online _prior_ to clamping the
index in kvm_get_vcpu().  If the index is ""bad"", the nospec clamping will
generate '0', i.e. KVM will return vCPU0 instead of NULL.

In practice, the bug is unlikely to cause problems, as it will only come
into play if userspace or the guest is buggy or misbehaving, e.g. KVM may
send interrupts to vCPU0 instead of dropping them on the floor.

However, returning vCPU0 when it shouldn't exist per online_vcpus is
problematic now that KVM uses an xarray for the vCPUs array, as KVM needs
to insert into the xarray before publishing the vCPU to userspace (see
commit c5b077549136 (""KVM: Convert the kvm->vcpus array to a xarray"")),
i.e. before vCPU creation is guaranteed to succeed.

As a result, incorrectly providing access to vCPU0 will trigger a
use-after-free if vCPU0 is dereferenced and kvm_vm_ioctl_create_vcpu()
bails out of vCPU creation due to an error and frees vCPU0.  Commit
afb2acb2e3a3 (""KVM: Fix vcpu_array[0] races"") papered over that issue, but
in doing so introduced an unsolvable teardown conundrum.  Preventing
accesses to vCPU0 before it's fully online will allow reverting commit
afb2acb2e3a3, without re-introducing the vcpu_array[0] UAF race."

batman-adv: Drop unmanaged ELP metric worker

The ELP worker needs to calculate new metric values for all neighbors
""reachable"" over an interface. Some of the used metric sources require
locks which might need to sleep. This sleep is incompatible with the RCU
list iterator used for the recorded neighbors. The initial approach to work
around of this problem was to queue another work item per neighbor and then
run this in a new context.

Even when this solved the RCU vs might_sleep() conflict, it has a major
problems: Nothing was stopping the work item in case it is not needed
anymore - for example because one of the related interfaces was removed or
the batman-adv module was unloaded - resulting in potential invalid memory
accesses.

Directly canceling the metric worker also has various problems:

* cancel_work_sync for a to-be-deactivated interface is called with
  rtnl_lock held. But the code in the ELP metric worker also tries to use
  rtnl_lock() - which will never return in this case. This also means that
  cancel_work_sync would never return because it is waiting for the worker
  to finish.
* iterating over the neighbor list for the to-be-deactivated interface is
  currently done using the RCU specific methods. Which means that it is
  possible to miss items when iterating over it without the associated
  spinlock - a behaviour which is acceptable for a periodic metric check
  but not for a cleanup routine (which must ""stop"" all still running
  workers)

The better approch is to get rid of the per interface neighbor metric
worker and handle everything in the interface worker. The original problems
are solved by:

* creating a list of neighbors which require new metric information inside
  the RCU protected context, gathering the metric according to the new list
  outside the RCU protected context
* only use rcu_trylock inside metric gathering code to avoid a deadlock
  when the cancel_delayed_work_sync is called in the interface removal code
  (which is called with the rtnl_lock held)"

tty: xilinx_uartps: split sysrq handling

return 0 and clear the NAPI_STATE_SCHED bit of napi->state, causing this
napi to be re-polled in net_rx_action() until __do_softirq() times out.
Since the NAPI_STATE_SCHED bit has been cleared, napi_schedule_rps() can

PCI: rcar-ep: Fix incorrect variable used when calling devm_request_mem_region()

The rcar_pcie_parse_outbound_ranges() uses the devm_request_mem_region()
macro to request a needed resource. A string variable that lives on the
stack is then used to store a dynamically computed resource name, which
is then passed on as one of the macro arguments. This can lead to
undefined behavior.

Depending on the current contents of the memory, the manifestations of
errors may vary. One possible output may be as follows:

  $ cat /proc/iomem
  30000000-37ffffff :
  38000000-3fffffff :

Sometimes, garbage may appear after the colon.

In very rare cases, if no NULL-terminator is found in memory, the system
might crash because the string iterator will overrun which can lead to
access of unmapped memory above the stack.

Thus, fix this by replacing outbound_name with the name of the previously
requested resource. With the changes applied, the output will be as
follows:

  $ cat /proc/iomem

When getting the IRQ we use k3_udma_glue_tx_get_irq() which returns
negative error value on error. So not NULL check is not sufficient

clocksource: Use migrate_disable() to avoid calling get_random_u32() in atomic context

The following bug report happened with a PREEMPT_RT kernel:

  BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at kernel/locking/spinlock_rt.c:48
  in_atomic(): 1, irqs_disabled(): 0, non_block: 0, pid: 2012, name: kwatchdog

  clocksource_verify_percpu.part.0+0x6b/0x330
  clocksource_watchdog_kthread+0x193/0x1a0

It is due to the fact that clocksource_verify_choose_cpus() is invoked with
preemption disabled.  This function invokes get_random_u32() to obtain
random numbers for choosing CPUs.  The batched_entropy_32 local lock and/or
the base_crng.lock spinlock in driver/char/random.c will be acquired during
the call. In PREEMPT_RT kernel, they are both sleeping locks and so cannot
be acquired in atomic context.

Fix this problem by using migrate_disable() to allow smp_processor_id() to
be reliably used without introducing atomic context. preempt_disable() is
then called after clocksource_verify_choose_cpus() but before the
clocksource measurement is being run to avoid introducing unexpected
latency."

btrfs: fix use-after-free when attempting to join an aborted transaction

When we are trying to join the current transaction and if it's aborted,
we read its 'aborted' field after unlocking fs_info->trans_lock and
without holding any extra reference count on it. This means that a
concurrent task that is aborting the transaction may free the transaction
before we read its 'aborted' field, leading to a use-after-free.

Fix this by reading the 'aborted' field while holding fs_info->trans_lock
since any freeing task must first acquire that lock and set
fs_info->running_transaction to NULL before freeing the transaction.

This was reported by syzbot and Dmitry with the following stack traces
from KASAN:

wifi: brcmfmac: fix NULL pointer dereference in brcmf_txfinalize()

On removal of the device or unloading of the kernel module a potential NULL
pointer dereference occurs.

The following sequence deletes the interface:

  brcmf_detach()
    brcmf_remove_interface()
      brcmf_del_if()

Inside the brcmf_del_if() function the drvr->if2bss[ifidx] is updated to
BRCMF_BSSIDX_INVALID (-1) if the bsscfgidx matches.

After brcmf_remove_interface() call the brcmf_proto_detach() function is
called providing the following sequence:

  brcmf_detach()
    brcmf_proto_detach()
      brcmf_proto_msgbuf_detach()

                brcmf_get_ifp()
                brcmf_txfinalize()

Since brcmf_get_ip() can and actually will return NULL in this case the
call to brcmf_txfinalize() will result in a NULL pointer dereference inside
brcmf_txfinalize() when trying to update ifp->ndev->stats.tx_errors.

This will only happen if a flowring still has an skb.

Although the NULL pointer dereference has only been seen when trying to
update the tx statistic, all other uses of the ifp pointer have been
guarded as well with an early return if ifp is NULL."

dummy-initialized channel to the global list accessible by many L2CAP

existing check to avoid exposing the serial number in that case, but it's
not correct: When checking the item_size returned by SMEM, we need to make

If 'mdelay(10)' is added before calling 'padata_find_next' in the
'padata_reorder' function, this issue could be reproduced easily with
ltp test (pcrypt_aead01).

This can be explained as bellow:

pcrypt_aead_encrypt
...
padata_do_parallel
refcount_inc(&pd->refcnt); // add refcnt
...
padata_do_serial
padata_reorder // pd
while (1) {
padata_find_next(pd, true); // using pd
queue_work_on
...
padata_serial_worker				crypto_del_alg
padata_put_pd_cnt // sub refcnt
						padata_free_shell
						padata_put_pd(ps->pd);
						// pd is freed
// loop again, but pd is freed
// call padata_find_next, UAF
}

In the padata_reorder function, when it loops in 'while', if the alg is
deleted, the refcnt may be decreased to 0 before entering
'padata_find_next', which leads to UAF.

As mentioned in [1], do_serial is supposed to be called with BHs disabled
and always happen under RCU protection, to address this issue, add
synchronize_rcu() in 'padata_free_shell' wait for all _do_serial calls
to finish.

This series fixes the buffer head state inconsistency issues reported by

read-only, and the associated buffer head use-after-free issue.


This patch (of 2):

Syzbot has reported that after nilfs2 detects filesystem corruption and
falls back to read-only, inconsistencies in the buffer state may occur.

One of the inconsistencies is that when nilfs2 calls mark_buffer_dirty()
to set a data or metadata buffer as dirty, but it detects that the buffer
is not in the uptodate state:

Both of these issues are caused by the callbacks that handle the
page/folio write requests, forcibly clear various states, including the
working state of the buffers they hold, at unexpected times when they
detect read-only fallback.

the page/folio state, and skipping the clear if it is."

nilfs2: handle errors that nilfs_prepare_chunk() may return

Patch series ""nilfs2: fix issues with rename operations"".

This series fixes BUG_ON check failures reported by syzbot around rename
operations, and a minor behavioral issue where the mtime of a child
directory changes when it is renamed instead of moved.


This patch (of 2):

The directory manipulation routines nilfs_set_link() and
nilfs_delete_entry() rewrite the directory entry in the folio/page
previously read by nilfs_find_entry(), so error handling is omitted on the
assumption that nilfs_prepare_chunk(), which prepares the buffer for
rewriting, will always succeed for these.  And if an error is returned, it
triggers the legacy BUG_ON() checks in each routine.

This assumption is wrong, as proven by syzbot: the buffer layer called by
nilfs_prepare_chunk() may call nilfs_get_block() if necessary, which may
fail due to metadata corruption or other reasons.  This has been there all
along, but improved sanity checks and error handling may have made it more
reproducible in fuzzing tests.

Fix this issue by adding missing error paths in nilfs_set_link(),
nilfs_delete_entry(), and their caller nilfs_rename()."

HID: core: Fix assumption that Resolution Multipliers must be in Logical Collections

A report in 2019 by the syzbot fuzzer was found to be connected to two
errors in the HID core associated with Resolution Multipliers.  One of
the errors was fixed by commit ea427a222d8b (""HID: core: Fix deadloop
in hid_apply_multiplier.""), but the other has not been fixed.

This error arises because hid_apply_multipler() assumes that every
Resolution Multiplier control is contained in a Logical Collection,
i.e., there's no way the routine can ever set multiplier_collection to
NULL.  This is in spite of the fact that the function starts with a
big comment saying:

	 * ""The Resolution Multiplier control must be contained in the same
	 * Logical Collection as the control(s) to which it is to be applied.
	   ...
	 *  If no Logical Collection is
	 * defined, the Resolution Multiplier is associated with all
	 * controls in the report.""
	 * HID Usage Table, v1.12, Section 4.3.1, p30
	 *
	 * Thus, search from the current collection upwards until we find a
	 * logical collection...

The comment and the code overlook the possibility that none of the
collections found may be a Logical Collection.

The fix is to set the multiplier_collection pointer to NULL if the
collection found isn't a Logical Collection."

usb: xhci: Fix NULL pointer dereference on certain command aborts

If a command is queued to the final usable TRB of a ring segment, the
enqueue pointer is advanced to the subsequent link TRB and no further.
If the command is later aborted, when the abort completion is handled
the dequeue pointer is advanced to the first TRB of the next segment.

If no further commands are queued, xhci_handle_stopped_cmd_ring() sees
the ring pointers unequal and assumes that there is a pending command,
so it calls xhci_mod_cmd_timer() which crashes if cur_cmd was NULL.

Don't attempt timer setup if cur_cmd is NULL. The subsequent doorbell
ring likely is unnecessary too, but it's harmless. Leave it alone.

This is probably Bug 219532, but no confirmation has been received.

The issue has been independently reproduced and confirmed fixed using
a USB MCU programmed to NAK the Status stage of SET_ADDRESS forever.

    refcount_t: underflow; use-after-free.
    kernel BUG at lib/list_debug.c:62!
    Kernel panic - not syncing: Oops - BUG: Fatal exception

This happens because pps_device_destruct() frees the pps_device with the
embedded cdev immediately after calling cdev_del(), but, as the comment
above cdev_del() notes, fops for previously opened cdevs are still
callable even after cdev_del() returns. I think this bug has always
been there: I can't explain why it suddenly started happening every time
I reboot this particular board.

In commit d953e0e837e6 (""pps: Fix a use-after free bug when
unregistering a source.""), George Spelvin suggested removing the
embedded cdev. That seems like the simplest way to fix this, so I've
implemented his suggestion, using __register_chrdev() with pps_idr
becoming the source of truth for which minor corresponds to which
device.

But now that pps_idr defines userspace visibility instead of cdev_add(),
we need to be sure the pps->dev refcount can't reach zero while
userspace can still find it again. So, the idr_remove() call moves to
pps_unregister_cdev(), and pps_idr now holds a reference to pps->dev.

perf/core: Fix data race between perf_event_set_output() and perf_mmap_close()

Yang Jihing reported a race between perf_event_set_output() and
perf_mmap_close():

	CPU1					CPU2

	perf_mmap_close(e2)
	  if (atomic_dec_and_test(&e2->rb->mmap_count)) // 1 - > 0
	    detach_rest = true

						ioctl(e1, IOC_SET_OUTPUT, e2)
						  perf_event_set_output(e1, e2)

	  ...
	  list_for_each_entry_rcu(e, &e2->rb->event_list, rb_entry)

								   &e2->rb->event_list)

After this; e1 is attached to an unmapped rb and a subsequent
perf_mmap() will loop forever more:

	again:
		mutex_lock(&e->mmap_mutex);
		if (event->rb) {
			...
			if (!atomic_inc_not_zero(&e->rb->mmap_count)) {
				...
				mutex_unlock(&e->mmap_mutex);
				goto again;
			}
		}

The loop in perf_mmap_close() holds e2->mmap_mutex, while the attach
in perf_event_set_output() holds e1->mmap_mutex. As such there is no
serialization to avoid this race.

Change perf_event_set_output() to take both e1->mmap_mutex and
e2->mmap_mutex to alleviate that problem. Additionally, have the loop
in perf_mmap() detach the rb directly, this avoids having to wait for
the concurrent perf_mmap_close() to get around to doing it to make
progress."

rxrpc: Fix listen() setting the bar too high for the prealloc rings

AF_RXRPC's listen() handler lets you set the backlog up to 32 (if you bump
up the sysctl), but whilst the preallocation circular buffers have 32 slots
in them, one of them has to be a dead slot because we're using CIRC_CNT().

This means that listen(rxrpc_sock, 32) will cause an oops when the socket
is closed because rxrpc_service_prealloc_one() allocated one too many calls
and rxrpc_discard_prealloc() won't then be able to get rid of them because
it'll think the ring is empty.  rxrpc_release_calls_on_socket() then tries
to abort them, but oopses because call->peer isn't yet set.

Fix this by setting the maximum backlog to RXRPC_BACKLOG_MAX - 1 to match
the ring capacity.

nvdimm: Fix firmware activation deadlock scenarios

Lockdep reports the following deadlock scenarios for CXL root device
power-management, device_prepare(), operations, and device_shutdown()
operations for 'nd_region' devices:

 Chain exists of:
   &nvdimm_region_key --> &nvdimm_bus->reconfig_mutex --> system_transition_mutex

  Possible unsafe locking scenario:

        CPU0                    CPU1
        ----                    ----
   lock(system_transition_mutex);

                                lock(system_transition_mutex);
   lock(&nvdimm_region_key);

 Chain exists of:
   &cxl_nvdimm_bridge_key --> acpi_scan_lock --> &cxl_root_key

  Possible unsafe locking scenario:

        CPU0                    CPU1
        ----                    ----

                                lock(&cxl_root_key);
   lock(&cxl_nvdimm_bridge_key);

These stem from holding nvdimm_bus_lock() over hibernate_quiet_exec()
which walks the entire system device topology taking device_lock() along
the way. The nvdimm_bus_lock() is protecting against unregistration,
multiple simultaneous ops callers, and preventing activate_show() from
racing activate_store(). For the first 2, the lock is redundant.
Unregistration already flushes all ops users, and sysfs already prevents
multiple threads to be active in an ops handler at the same time. For
the last userspace should already be waiting for its last
activate_store() to complete, and does not need activate_show() to flush
the write side, so this lock usage can be deleted in these attributes."

tty: fix deadlock caused by calling printk() under tty_port->lock

pty_write() invokes kmalloc() which may invoke a normal printk() to print
failure message.  This can cause a deadlock in the scenario reported by
syz-bot below:

       CPU0              CPU1                    CPU2
       ----              ----                    ----
                         lock(console_owner);
                                                 lock(&port_lock_key);
  lock(&port->lock);
                         lock(&port_lock_key);
                                                 lock(&port->lock);
  lock(console_owner);

As commit dbdda842fe96 (""printk: Add console owner and waiter logic to
load balance console writes"") said, such deadlock can be prevented by
using printk_deferred() in kmalloc() (which is invoked in the section
guarded by the port->lock).  But there are too many printk() on the
kmalloc() path, and kmalloc() can be called from anywhere, so changing
printk() to printk_deferred() is too complicated and inelegant.

Therefore, this patch chooses to specify __GFP_NOWARN to kmalloc(), so
that printk() will not be called, and this deadlock problem can be
avoided.

bcache: avoid journal no-space deadlock by reserving 1 journal bucket

The journal no-space deadlock was reported time to time. Such deadlock
can happen in the following situation.

When all journal buckets are fully filled by active jset with heavy
write I/O load, the cache set registration (after a reboot) will load
all active jsets and inserting them into the btree again (which is
called journal replay). If a journaled bkey is inserted into a btree
node and results btree node split, new journal request might be
triggered. For example, the btree grows one more level after the node
split, then the root node record in cache device super block will be
upgrade by bch_journal_meta() from bch_btree_set_root(). But there is no
space in journal buckets, the journal replay has to wait for new journal
bucket to be reclaimed after at least one journal bucket replayed. This
is one example that how the journal no-space deadlock happens.

The solution to avoid the deadlock is to reserve 1 journal bucket in
run time, and only permit the reserved journal bucket to be used during
cache set registration procedure for things like journal replay. Then
the journal space will never be fully filled, there is no chance for
journal no-space deadlock to happen anymore.

This patch adds a new member ""bool do_reserve"" in struct journal, it is
inititalized to 0 (false) when struct journal is allocated, and set to
1 (true) by bch_journal_space_reserve() when all initialization done in
run_cache_set(). In the run time when journal_reclaim() tries to
allocate a new journal bucket, free_journal_buckets() is called to check
whether there are enough free journal buckets to use. If there is only
1 free journal bucket and journal->do_reserve is 1 (true), the last
bucket is reserved and free_journal_buckets() will return 0 to indicate
no free journal bucket. Then journal_reclaim() will give up, and try
next time to see whetheer there is free journal bucket to allocate. By
this method, there is always 1 jouranl bucket reserved in run time.

During the cache set registration, journal->do_reserve is 0 (false), so
the reserved journal bucket can be used to avoid the no-space deadlock."

rtl818x: Prevent using not initialized queues

Using not existing queues can panic the kernel with rtl8180/rtl8185 cards.
Ignore the skb priority for those cards, they only have one tx queue. Pierre
Asselin (pa@panix.com) reported the kernel crash in the Gentoo forum:

https://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-1147832-postdays-0-postorder-asc-start-25.html

He also confirmed that this patch fixes the issue. In summary this happened:

After updating wpa_supplicant from 2.9 to 2.10 the kernel crashed with a
""divide error: 0000"" when connecting to an AP. Control port tx now tries to
use IEEE80211_AC_VO for the priority, which wpa_supplicants starts to use in
2.10.

Since only the rtl8187se part of the driver supports QoS, the priority
of the skb is set to IEEE80211_AC_BE (2) by mac80211 for rtl8180/rtl8185
cards.

rtl8180 is then unconditionally reading out the priority and finally crashes on
drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtl818x/rtl8180/dev.c line 544 without this
patch:
	idx = (ring->idx + skb_queue_len(&ring->queue)) % ring->entries

drm/msm/dp: populate connector of struct dp_panel

DP CTS test case 4.2.2.6 has valid edid with bad checksum on purpose

correct edid checksum is calculated and stored at
connector::real_edid_checksum.

The problem is struct dp_panel::connector never be assigned, instead the
connector is stored in struct msm_dp::connector. When we run compliance
testing test case 4.2.2.6 dp_panel_handle_sink_request() won't have a valid
edid set in struct dp_panel::edid so we'll try to use the connectors

connector pointer is never assigned.

vfio/pci: fix memory leak during D3hot to D0 transition

If 'vfio_pci_core_device::needs_pm_restore' is set (PCI device does
not have No_Soft_Reset bit set in its PMCSR config register), then
the current PCI state will be saved locally in
'vfio_pci_core_device::pm_save' during D0->D3hot transition and same
will be restored back during D3hot->D0 transition.
For saving the PCI state locally, pci_store_saved_state() is being
used and the pci_load_and_free_saved_state() will free the allocated
memory.

But for reset related IOCTLs, vfio driver calls PCI reset-related
API's which will internally change the PCI power state back to D0. So,
when the guest resumes, then it will get the current state as D0 and it
will skip the call to vfio_pci_set_power_state() for changing the
power state to D0 explicitly. In this case, the memory pointed by
'pm_save' will never be freed. In a malicious sequence, the state changing
to D3hot followed by VFIO_DEVICE_RESET/VFIO_DEVICE_PCI_HOT_RESET can be
run in a loop and it can cause an OOM situation.

This patch frees the earlier allocated memory first before overwriting
'pm_save' to prevent the mentioned memory leak."

Fix a race in the xsk socket teardown code that can lead to a NULL pointer

setting xs->state to XSK_UNBOUND, sets xs->dev to NULL and then waits for any

There are two problems with the current code. First, setting xs->dev to NULL
before waiting for all users to stop using the socket is not correct. The
entry to the data plane functions xsk_poll(), xsk_sendmsg(), and xsk_recvmsg()
are all guarded by a test that xs->state is in the state XSK_BOUND and if not,
it returns right away. But one process might have passed this test but still
have not gotten to the point in which it uses xs->dev in the code. In this
interim, a second process executing xsk_unbind_dev() might have set xs->dev to
NULL which will lead to a crash for the first process. The solution here is
just to get rid of this NULL assignment since it is not used anymore. Before
commit 42fddcc7c64b (""xsk: use state member for socket synchronization""),
xs->dev was the gatekeeper to admit processes into the data plane functions,
but it was replaced with the state variable xs->state in the aforementioned
commit.

The second problem is that synchronize_net() does not wait for any process in
xsk_poll(), xsk_sendmsg(), or xsk_recvmsg() to complete, which means that the
state they rely on might be cleaned up prematurely. This can happen when the
notifier gets called (at driver unload for example) as it uses xsk_unbind_dev().
Solve this by extending the RCU critical region from just the ndo_xsk_wakeup
to the whole functions mentioned above, so that both the test of xs->state ==
XSK_BOUND and the last use of any member of xs is covered by the RCU critical
section. This will guarantee that when synchronize_net() completes, there will
be no processes left executing xsk_poll(), xsk_sendmsg(), or xsk_recvmsg() and
state can be cleaned up safely. Note that we need to drop the RCU lock for the
skb xmit path as it uses functions that might sleep. Due to this, we have to
retest the xs->state after we grab the mutex that protects the skb xmit code
from, among a number of things, an xsk_unbind_dev() being executed from the
notifier at the same time."

drm/amd/display: Fix double free during GPU reset on DC streams

[Why]
The issue only occurs during the GPU reset code path.

We first backup the current state prior to commiting 0 streams
internally from DM to DC. This state backup contains valid link
encoder assignments.

DC will clear the link encoder assignments as part of current state
(but not the backup, since it was a copied before the commit) and
free the extra stream reference it held.

DC requires that the link encoder assignments remain cleared/invalid
prior to commiting. Since the backup still has valid assignments we
call the interface post reset to clear them. This routine also
releases the extra reference that the link encoder interface held -
resulting in a double free (and eventually a NULL pointer dereference).

[How]
We'll have to do a full DC commit anyway after GPU reset because
the stream count previously went to 0.

We don't need to retain the assignment that we had backed up, so
just copy off of the now clean current state assignment after the
reset has occcurred with the new link_enc_cfg_copy() interface."

The immediate cause of the crash is the access of tx_scrq in the following
snippet during a reset, where the tx_scrq can be either NULL or an address
that will soon be invalid:

	ibmvnic_xmit()
	{
		...
		tx_scrq = adapter->tx_scrq[queue_num];
		txq = netdev_get_tx_queue(netdev, queue_num);
		ind_bufp = &tx_scrq->ind_buf;

		if (test_bit(0, &adapter->resetting)) {
		...
	}

But beyond that, the call to ibmvnic_xmit() itself is not safe during a
reset and the reset path attempts to avoid this by stopping the queue in
ibmvnic_cleanup(). However just after the queue was stopped, an in-flight
ibmvnic_complete_tx() could have restarted the queue even as the reset is
progressing.

Since the queue was restarted we could get a call to ibmvnic_xmit() which
can then access the bad tx_scrq (or other fields).

We cannot however simply have ibmvnic_complete_tx() check the ->resetting
bit and skip starting the queue. This can race at the ""back-end"" of a good
reset which just restarted the queue but has not cleared the ->resetting
bit yet. If we skip restarting the queue due to ->resetting being true,
the queue would remain stopped indefinitely potentially leading to transmit
timeouts.

IOW ->resetting is too broad for this purpose. Instead use a new flag
that indicates whether or not the queues are active. Only the open/
reset paths control when the queues are active. ibmvnic_complete_tx()
and others wake up the queue only if the queue is marked active.

So we will have:
	A. reset/open thread in ibmvnic_cleanup() and __ibmvnic_open()

		->resetting = true
		->tx_queues_active = false
		disable tx queues
		...
		->tx_queues_active = true
		start tx queues

	B. Tx interrupt in ibmvnic_complete_tx():

		if (->tx_queues_active)
			netif_wake_subqueue();

To ensure that ->tx_queues_active and state of the queues are consistent,
we need a lock which:

	- must also be taken in the interrupt path (ibmvnic_complete_tx())
	- shared across the multiple

net: sfc: add missing xdp queue reinitialization

After rx/tx ring buffer size is changed, kernel panic occurs when
it acts XDP_TX or XDP_REDIRECT.

When tx/rx ring buffer size is changed(ethtool -G), sfc driver
reallocates and reinitializes rx and tx queues and their buffer
(tx_queue->buffer).
But it misses reinitializing xdp queues(efx->xdp_tx_queues).
So, while it is acting XDP_TX or XDP_REDIRECT, it uses the uninitialized
tx_queue->buffer.

A new function efx_set_xdp_channels() is separated from efx_set_channels()
to handle only xdp queues.

SUNRPC: Fix the svc_deferred_event trace class

Fix a NULL deref crash that occurs when an svc_rqst is deferred
while the sunrpc tracing subsystem is enabled. svc_revisit() sets
dr->xprt to NULL, so it can't be relied upon in the tracepoint to
provide the remote's address.

Unfortunately we can't revert the ""svc_deferred_class"" hunk in
commit ece200ddd54b (""sunrpc: Save remote presentation address in
svc_xprt for trace events"") because there is now a specific check
of event format specifiers for unsafe dereferences. The warning
that check emits is:

  event svc_defer_recv has unsafe dereference of argument 1

A ""%pISpc"" format specifier with a ""struct sockaddr *"" is indeed
flagged by this check.

Instead, take the brute-force approach used by the svcrdma_qp_error
tracepoint. Convert the dr::addr field into a presentation address
in the TP_fast_assign() arm of the trace event, and store that as
a string. This fix can be backported to -stable kernels.

In the meantime, commit c6ced22997ad (""tracing: Update print fmt
check to handle new __get_sockaddr() macro"") is now in v5.18, so
this wonky fix can be replaced with __sockaddr() and friends
properly during the v5.19 merge window."

Remove the read / modify / write sequence to make the operation atomic
and remove the spin_lock() in change_page_attr().

To do the operation atomically, we can't use pte modification helpers
anymore. Because all platforms have different combination of bits, it
is not easy to use those bits directly. But all have the
_PAGE_KERNEL_{RO/ROX/RW/RWX} set of flags. All we need it to compare
two sets to know which bits are set or cleared.

For instance, by comparing _PAGE_KERNEL_ROX and _PAGE_KERNEL_RO you
know which bit gets cleared and which bit get set when changing exec

pfifo_tail_enqueue: Drop new packet when sch->limit == 0

Expected behaviour:
In case we reach scheduler's limit, pfifo_tail_enqueue() will drop a
packet in scheduler's queue and decrease scheduler's qlen by one.
Then, pfifo_tail_enqueue() enqueue new packet and increase
scheduler's qlen by one. Finally, pfifo_tail_enqueue() return
`NET_XMIT_CN` status code.

Weird behaviour:
In case we set `sch->limit == 0` and trigger pfifo_tail_enqueue() on a
scheduler that has no packet, the 'drop a packet' step will do nothing.
This means the scheduler's qlen still has value equal 0.
Then, we continue to enqueue new packet and increase scheduler's qlen by
one. In summary, we can leverage pfifo_tail_enqueue() to increase qlen by
one and return `NET_XMIT_CN` status code.

The problem is:
Let's say we have two qdiscs: Qdisc_A and Qdisc_B.
 - Qdisc_A's type must have '->graft()' function to create parent/child relationship.
   Let's say Qdisc_A's type is `hfsc`. Enqueue packet to this qdisc will trigger `hfsc_enqueue`.
 - Qdisc_B's type is pfifo_head_drop. Enqueue packet to this qdisc will trigger `pfifo_tail_enqueue`.
 - Qdisc_B is configured to have `sch->limit == 0`.
 - Qdisc_A is configured to route the enqueued's packet to Qdisc_B.

Enqueue packet through Qdisc_A will lead to:
 - hfsc_enqueue(Qdisc_A) -> pfifo_tail_enqueue(Qdisc_B)
 - Qdisc_B->q.qlen += 1
 - pfifo_tail_enqueue() return `NET_XMIT_CN`
 - hfsc_enqueue() check for `NET_XMIT_SUCCESS` and see `NET_XMIT_CN` => hfsc_enqueue() don't increase qlen of Qdisc_A.

The whole process lead to a situation where Qdisc_A->q.qlen == 0 and Qdisc_B->q.qlen == 1.
Replace 'hfsc' with other type (for example: 'drr') still lead to the same problem.
This violate the design where parent's qlen should equal to the sum of its childrens'qlen.

ethnl operations while dismantle has started is not a good idea.

was already there in ethnl_ops_begin, but not wide enough.

net: sched: Disallow replacing of child qdisc from one parent to another

Lion Ackermann was able to create a UAF which can be abused for privilege
escalation with the following script

Step 1. create root qdisc
tc qdisc add dev lo root handle 1:0 drr

step2. a class for packet aggregation do demonstrate uaf
tc class add dev lo classid 1:1 drr

step3. a class for nesting
tc class add dev lo classid 1:2 drr

step4. a class to graft qdisc to
tc class add dev lo classid 1:3 drr

step5.
tc qdisc add dev lo parent 1:1 handle 2:0 plug limit 1024

step6.
tc qdisc add dev lo parent 1:2 handle 3:0 drr

step7.
tc class add dev lo classid 3:1 drr

step 8.
tc qdisc add dev lo parent 3:1 handle 4:0 pfifo

step 9. Display the class/qdisc layout

tc class ls dev lo
 class drr 1:1 root leaf 2: quantum 64Kb
 class drr 1:2 root leaf 3: quantum 64Kb
 class drr 3:1 root leaf 4: quantum 64Kb

tc qdisc ls
 qdisc drr 1: dev lo root refcnt 2
 qdisc plug 2: dev lo parent 1:1
 qdisc pfifo 4: dev lo parent 3:1 limit 1000p
 qdisc drr 3: dev lo parent 1:2

step10. trigger the bug <=== prevented by this patch
tc qdisc replace dev lo parent 1:3 handle 4:0

step 11. Redisplay again the qdiscs/classes

tc class ls dev lo
 class drr 1:1 root leaf 2: quantum 64Kb
 class drr 1:2 root leaf 3: quantum 64Kb
 class drr 1:3 root leaf 4: quantum 64Kb
 class drr 3:1 root leaf 4: quantum 64Kb

tc qdisc ls
 qdisc drr 1: dev lo root refcnt 2
 qdisc plug 2: dev lo parent 1:1
 qdisc pfifo 4: dev lo parent 3:1 refcnt 2 limit 1000p
 qdisc drr 3: dev lo parent 1:2

Observe that a) parent for 4:0 does not change despite the replace request.
There can only be one parent.  b) refcount has gone up by two for 4:0 and
c) both class 1:3 and 3:1 are pointing to it.

Step 12.  send one packet to plug
echo """" | socat -u STDIN UDP4-DATAGRAM:127.0.0.1:8888,priority=$((0x10001))
step13.  send one packet to the grafted fifo
echo """" | socat -u STDIN UDP4-DATAGRAM:127.0.0.1:8888,priority=$((0x10003))

step14. lets trigger the uaf
tc class delete dev lo classid 1:3
tc class delete dev lo classid 1:1

The semantics of ""replace"" is for a del/add _on the same node_ and not
a delete from one node(3:1) and add to another node (1:3) as in step10.
While we could ""fix"" with a more complex approach there could be
consequences to expectations so the patch takes the preventive approach of
""disallow such config"".

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/01/28/3,N/A,CVE-2024-23953,UNKNOWN,N/A,"Use of Arrays.equals() in LlapSignerImpl in Apache Hive to compare message signatures allows attacker to forge a valid signature for an arbitrary message byte by byte. The attacker should be an authorized user of the product to perform this attack. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.0, which fixes this issue.

The problem occurs when an application doesn’t use a constant-time algorithm for validating a signature. The method Arrays.equals() returns false right away when it sees that one of the input’s bytes are different. It means that the comparison time depends on the contents of the arrays. This little thing may allow an attacker to forge a valid signature for an arbitrary message byte by byte. So it might allow malicious users to submit splits/work with selected signatures to LLAP without running as a privileged user, potentially leading to DDoS attack.

the private key exists in the ECDSA signature computation.

Impact summary: A timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computations
could allow recovering the private key by an attacker. However, measuring
the timing would require either local access to the signing application or
a very fast network connection with low latency.

There is a timing signal of around 300 nanoseconds when the top word of
the inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero. This can happen with significant
probability only for some of the supported elliptic curves. In particular
the NIST P-521 curve is affected. To be able to measure this leak, the attacker
process must either be located in the same physical computer or must
have a very fast network connection with low latency. For that reason
the severity of this vulnerability is Low.

The FIPS modules in 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are affected by this issue."
https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/27202e2e8721c3b23831563c36ed5ac7818641ba,N/A,CVE-2025-21647,UNKNOWN,N/A,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched: sch_cake: add bounds checks to host bulk flow fairness counts

Even though we fixed a logic error in the commit cited below, syzbot
still managed to trigger an underflow of the per-host bulk flow
counters, leading to an out of bounds memory access.

To avoid any such logic errors causing out of bounds memory accesses,
this commit factors out all accesses to the per-host bulk flow counters
to a series of helpers that perform bounds-checking before any
increments and decrements. This also has the benefit of improving
readability by moving the conditional checks for the flow mode into
these helpers, instead of having them spread out throughout the
code (which was the cause of the original logic error).

As part of this change, the flow quantum calculation is consolidated
into a helper function, which means that the dithering applied to the
ost load scaling is now applied both in the DRR rotation and when a
sparse flow's quantum is first initiated. The only user-visible effect
of this is that the maximum packet size that can be sent while a flow
stays sparse will now vary with +/- one byte in some cases. This should
not make a noticeable difference in practice, and thus it's not worth
complicating the code to preserve the old behaviour."

When populating cache leaves we previously fetched the CPU device node
at the very beginning. But when ACPI is enabled we go through a
specific branch which returns early and does not call 'of_node_put' for
the node that was acquired.

Since we are not using a CPU device node for the ACPI code anyways, we
can simply move the initialization of it just passed the ACPI block, and
we are guaranteed to have an 'of_node_put' call for the acquired node.
This prevents a bad reference count of the CPU device node.

Moreover, the previous function did not check for errors when acquiring

This issue affects Apache Pinot: from 0.1 before 1.0.0.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.0.0 and configure RBAC, which fixes the issue.

Details: 

When using a request to path “/appconfigs” to the controller, it can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information such as system information (e.g. arch, os version), environment information (e.g. maxHeapSize) and Pinot configurations (e.g. zookeeper path). This issue was addressed by the  Role-based Access Control https://docs.pinot.apache.org/operators/tutorials/authentication/basic-auth-access-control , so that /appConfigs` and all other APIs can be access controlled. Only authorized users have access to it. Note the user needs to add the admin role accordingly to the RBAC guide to control access to this endpoint, and in the future version of Pinot, a default admin role is planned to be added.

https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/security/advisories/GHSA-6jj6-gm7p-fcvv,CWE-94,CVE-2024-36401,CRITICAL,9.8,"GeoServer is an open source server that allows users to share and edit geospatial data. Prior to versions 2.22.6, 2.23.6, 2.24.4, and 2.25.2, multiple OGC request parameters allow Remote Code Execution (RCE) by unauthenticated users through specially crafted input against a default GeoServer installation due to unsafely evaluating property names as XPath expressions.

The GeoTools library API that GeoServer calls evaluates property/attribute names for feature types in a way that unsafely passes them to the commons-jxpath library which can execute arbitrary code when evaluating XPath expressions. This XPath evaluation is intended to be used only by complex feature types (i.e., Application Schema data stores) but is incorrectly being applied to simple feature types as well which makes this vulnerability apply to **ALL** GeoServer instances. No public PoC is provided but this vulnerability has been confirmed to be exploitable through WFS GetFeature, WFS GetPropertyValue, WMS GetMap, WMS GetFeatureInfo, WMS GetLegendGraphic and WPS Execute requests. This vulnerability can lead to executing arbitrary code.

Versions 2.22.6, 2.23.6, 2.24.4, and 2.25.2 contain a patch for the issue. A workaround exists by removing the `gt-complex-x.y.jar` file from the GeoServer where `x.y` is the GeoTools version (e.g., `gt-complex-31.1.jar` if running GeoServer 2.25.1). This will remove the vulnerable code from GeoServer but may break some GeoServer functionality or prevent GeoServer from deploying if the gt-complex module is needed."

That out of bounds access is ultimately caused because the inode
has an inode number with the invalid value of zero, which was not checked.

The reason this causes the out of bounds access is due to following
sequence of events:

1. Fill_meta_index() is called to allocate (via empty_meta_index())
   and fill a metadata index.  It however suffers a data read error
   and aborts, invalidating the newly returned empty metadata index.
   It does this by setting the inode number of the index to zero,
   which means unused (zero is not a valid inode number).

2. When fill_meta_index() is subsequently called again on another
   read operation, locate_meta_index() returns the previous index
   because it matches the inode number of 0.  Because this index
   has been returned it is expected to have been filled, and because
   it hasn't been, an out of bounds access is performed.

This patch adds a sanity check which checks that the inode number
is not zero when the inode is created and returns -EINVAL if it is.

mm: swap: fix race between free_swap_and_cache() and swapoff()

There was previously a theoretical window where swapoff() could run and
teardown a swap_info_struct while a call to free_swap_and_cache() was
running in another thread.  This could cause, amongst other bad
possibilities, swap_page_trans_huge_swapped() (called by
free_swap_and_cache()) to access the freed memory for swap_map.

This is a theoretical problem and I haven't been able to provoke it from a
test case.  But there has been agreement based on code review that this is
possible (see link below).

Fix it by using get_swap_device()/put_swap_device(), which will stall
swapoff().  There was an extra check in _swap_info_get() to confirm that
the swap entry was not free.  This isn't present in get_swap_device()
because it doesn't make sense in general due to the race between getting
the reference and swapoff.  So I've added an equivalent check directly in
free_swap_and_cache().

Details of how to provoke one possible issue (thanks to David Hildenbrand
for deriving this):

--8<-----

__swap_entry_free() might be the last user and result in
""count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE"".

swapoff->try_to_unuse() will stop as soon as soon as si->inuse_pages==0.

So the question is: could someone reclaim the folio and turn
si->inuse_pages==0, before we completed swap_page_trans_huge_swapped().

Imagine the following: 2 MiB folio in the swapcache. Only 2 subpages are
still references by swap entries.

Process 1 still references subpage 0 via swap entry.
Process 2 still references subpage 1 via swap entry.

Process 1 quits. Calls free_swap_and_cache().
-> count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE
[then, preempted in the hypervisor etc.]

Process 2 quits. Calls free_swap_and_cache().
-> count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE

Process 2 goes ahead, passes swap_page_trans_huge_swapped(), and calls
__try_to_reclaim_swap().

__try_to_reclaim_swap()->folio_free_swap()->delete_from_swap_cache()->
put_swap_folio()->free_swap_slot()->swapcache_free_entries()->
swap_entry_free()->swap_range_free()->
...
WRITE_ONCE(si->inuse_pages, si->inuse_pages - nr_entries);

What stops swapoff to succeed after process 2 reclaimed the swap cache
but before process1 finished its call to swap_page_trans_huge_swapped()?

s390/zcrypt: fix reference counting on zcrypt card objects

Tests with hot-plugging crytpo cards on KVM guests with debug
kernel build revealed an use after free for the load field of
the struct zcrypt_card. The reason was an incorrect reference
handling of the zcrypt card object which could lead to a free
of the zcrypt card object while it was still in use.

The root cause is:
  1. packet_snd() only reset skb->mac_header when sock->type is SOCK_RAW
     and skb->protocol is not specified as in packet_parse_headers()

  2. packet_direct_xmit() doesn't reset skb->mac_header as dev_queue_xmit()

In this case, skb->mac_header is 65535 when ipvlan_xmit_mode_l2() is
called. So when ipvlan_xmit_mode_l2() gets mac header with eth_hdr() which
use ""skb->head + skb->mac_header"", out-of-bound access occurs.

This patch replaces eth_hdr() with skb_eth_hdr() in ipvlan_xmit_mode_l2()
and reset mac header in multicast to solve this out-of-bound bug."

Thus, if Amplify CLI had been used to remove the Authentication component from a project built between August 2019 and January 2024, an ""assume role"" may have occurred, and may have been leveraged to obtain unauthorized access to an organization's AWS resources. NOTE: the problem could only occur if an authorized AWS user removed an Authentication component. (The vulnerability did not give a threat actor the ability to remove an Authentication component.)

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/12/7,N/A,CVE-2024-31391,UNKNOWN,N/A,"Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File vulnerability in the Apache Solr Operator.

This issue affects all versions of the Apache Solr Operator from 0.3.0 through 0.8.0.

When asked to bootstrap Solr security, the operator will enable basic authentication and create several accounts for accessing Solr: including the ""solr"" and ""admin"" accounts for use by end-users, and a ""k8s-oper"" account which the operator uses for its own requests to Solr.
One common source of these operator requests is healthchecks: liveness, readiness, and startup probes are all used to determine Solr's health and ability to receive traffic.
By default, the operator configures the Solr APIs used for these probes to be exempt from authentication, but users may specifically request that authentication be required on probe endpoints as well.
Whenever one of these probes would fail, if authentication was in use, the Solr Operator would create a Kubernetes ""event"" containing the username and password of the ""k8s-oper"" account.

Within the affected version range, this vulnerability affects any solrcloud resource which (1) bootstrapped security through use of the `.solrOptions.security.authenticationType=basic` option, and (2) required authentication be used on probes by setting `.solrOptions.security.probesRequireAuth=true`.

Users are recommended to upgrade to Solr Operator version 0.8.1, which fixes this issue by ensuring that probes no longer print the credentials used for Solr requests.  Users may also mitigate the vulnerability by disabling authentication on their healthcheck probes using the setting `.solrOptions.security.probesRequireAuth=false`."

vfio/pci: Create persistent INTx handler

A vulnerability exists where the eventfd for INTx signaling can be
deconfigured, which unregisters the IRQ handler but still allows
eventfds to be signaled with a NULL context through the SET_IRQS ioctl
or through unmask irqfd if the device interrupt is pending.

Ideally this could be solved with some additional locking; the igate
mutex serializes the ioctl and config space accesses, and the interrupt
handler is unregistered relative to the trigger, but the irqfd path
runs asynchronous to those.  The igate mutex cannot be acquired from the
atomic context of the eventfd wake function.  Disabling the irqfd
relative to the eventfd registration is potentially incompatible with
existing userspace.

As a result, the solution implemented here moves configuration of the
INTx interrupt handler to track the lifetime of the INTx context object
and irq_type configuration, rather than registration of a particular
trigger eventfd.  Synchronization is added between the ioctl path and
eventfd_signal() wrapper such that the eventfd trigger can be
dynamically updated relative to in-flight interrupts or irqfd callbacks."

mm/vmscan: fix a bug calling wakeup_kswapd() with a wrong zone index

With numa balancing on, when a numa system is running where a numa node
doesn't have its local memory so it has no managed zones, the following
oops has been observed.  It's because wakeup_kswapd() is called with a
wrong zone index, -1.  Fixed it by checking the index before calling
wakeup_kswapd().

af_unix: Fix task hung while purging oob_skb in GC.

syzbot reported a task hung; at the same time, GC was looping infinitely
in list_for_each_entry_safe() for OOB skb.  [0]

syzbot demonstrated that the list_for_each_entry_safe() was not actually
safe in this case.

A single skb could have references for multiple sockets.  If we free such
a skb in the list_for_each_entry_safe(), the current and next sockets could
be unlinked in a single iteration.

unix_notinflight() uses list_del_init() to unlink the socket, so the
prefetched next socket forms a loop itself and list_for_each_entry_safe()
never stops.

Here, we must use while() and make sure we always fetch the first socket.

af_unix: Drop oob_skb ref before purging queue in GC.

syzbot reported another task hung in __unix_gc().  [0]

The current while loop assumes that all of the left candidates
have oob_skb and calling kfree_skb(oob_skb) releases the remaining
candidates.

However, I missed a case that oob_skb has self-referencing fd and
another fd and the latter sk is placed before the former in the
candidate list.  Then, the while loop never proceeds, resulting
the task hung.

__unix_gc() has the same loop just before purging the collected skb,
so we can call kfree_skb(oob_skb) there and let __skb_queue_purge()
release all inflight sockets.

cxl/pci: Skip to handle RAS errors if CXL.mem device is detached

The PCI AER model is an awkward fit for CXL error handling. While the
expectation is that a PCI device can escalate to link reset to recover
from an AER event, the same reset on CXL amounts to a surprise memory
hotplug of massive amounts of memory.

At present, the CXL error handler attempts some optimistic error
handling to unbind the device from the cxl_mem driver after reaping some
RAS register values. This results in a ""hopeful"" attempt to unplug the
memory, but there is no guarantee that will succeed.

A subsequent AER notification after the memdev unbind event can no
longer assume the registers are mapped. Check for memdev bind before
reaping status register values to avoid crashes of the form:

cxl/pci: Fix disabling memory if DVSEC CXL Range does not match a CFMWS window

The Linux CXL subsystem is built on the assumption that HPA == SPA.
That is, the host physical address (HPA) the HDM decoder registers are
programmed with are system physical addresses (SPA).

During HDM decoder setup, the DVSEC CXL range registers (cxl-3.1,
8.1.3.8) are checked if the memory is enabled and the CXL range is in
a HPA window that is described in a CFMWS structure of the CXL host
bridge (cxl-3.1, 9.18.1.3).

Now, if the HPA is not an SPA, the CXL range does not match a CFMWS
window and the CXL memory range will be disabled then. The HDM decoder
stops working which causes system memory being disabled and further a
system hang during HDM decoder initialization, typically when a CXL
enabled kernel boots.

Prevent a system hang and do not disable the HDM decoder if the
decoder's CXL range is not found in a CFMWS window.

Note the change only fixes a hardware hang, but does not implement
HPA/SPA translation. Support for this can be added in a follow on
patch series."

mm/swap: fix race when skipping swapcache

When skipping swapcache for SWP_SYNCHRONOUS_IO, if two or more threads
swapin the same entry at the same time, they get different pages (A, B). 
Before one thread (T0) finishes the swapin and installs page (A) to the
PTE, another thread (T1) could finish swapin of page (B), swap_free the
entry, then swap out the possibly modified page reusing the same entry. 
It breaks the pte_same check in (T0) because PTE value is unchanged,
causing ABA problem.  Thread (T0) will install a stalled page (A) into the
PTE and cause data corruption.

One possible callstack is like this:

CPU0                                 CPU1
----                                 ----
do_swap_page()                       do_swap_page() with same entry
<direct swapin path>                 <direct swapin path>
<alloc page A>                       <alloc page B>
swap_read_folio() <- read to page A  swap_read_folio() <- read to page B
<slow on later locks or interrupt>   <finished swapin first>
...                                  set_pte_at()
                                     swap_free() <- entry is free
                                     <write to page B, now page A stalled>
                                     <swap out page B to same swap entry>
pte_same() <- Check pass, PTE seems
              unchanged, but page A
              is stalled!
swap_free() <- page B content lost!
set_pte_at() <- staled page A installed!

And besides, for ZRAM, swap_free() allows the swap device to discard the
entry content, so even if page (B) is not modified, if swap_read_folio()
on CPU0 happens later than swap_free() on CPU1, it may also cause data
loss.

To fix this, reuse swapcache_prepare which will pin the swap entry using
the cache flag, and allow only one thread to swap it in, also prevent any
parallel code from putting the entry in the cache.  Release the pin after
PT unlocked.

Racers just loop and wait since it's a rare and very short event.  A
schedule_timeout_uninterruptible(1) call is added to avoid repeated page
faults wasting too much CPU, causing livelock or adding too much noise to
perf statistics.  A similar livelock issue was described in commit
029c4628b2eb (""mm: swap: get rid of livelock in swapin readahead"")

Reproducer:

This race issue can be triggered easily using a well constructed
reproducer and patched brd (with a delay in read path) [1]:

With latest 6.8 mainline, race caused data loss can be observed easily:
$ gcc -g -lpthread test-thread-swap-race.c && ./a.out
  Polulating 32MB of memory region...
  Keep swapping out...
  Starting round 0...
  Spawning 65536 workers...
  32746 workers spawned, wait for done...
  Round 0: Error on 0x5aa00, expected 32746, got 32743, 3 data loss!
  Round 0: Error on 0x395200, expected 32746, got 32743, 3 data loss!
  Round 0: Error on 0x3fd000, expected 32746, got 32737, 9 data loss!
  Round 0 Failed, 15 data loss!

This reproducer spawns multiple threads sharing the same memory region
using a small swap device.  Every two threads updates mapped pages one by
one in opposite direction trying to create a race, with one dedicated
thread keep swapping out the data out using madvise.

The reproducer created a reproduce rate of about once every 5 minutes, so
the race should be totally possible in production.

After this patch, I ran the reproducer for over a few hundred rounds and
no data loss observed.

scsi: smartpqi: Fix disable_managed_interrupts

Correct blk-mq registration issue with module parameter
disable_managed_interrupts enabled.

When we turn off the default PCI_IRQ_AFFINITY flag, the driver needs to
register with blk-mq using blk_mq_map_queues(). The driver is currently
calling blk_mq_pci_map_queues() which results in a stack trace and possibly
undefined behavior.

dccp/tcp: Unhash sk from ehash for tb2 alloc failure after check_estalblished().

syzkaller reported a warning [0] in inet_csk_destroy_sock() with no
repro.

  WARN_ON(inet_sk(sk)->inet_num && !inet_csk(sk)->icsk_bind_hash);

However, the syzkaller's log hinted that connect() failed just before
the warning due to FAULT_INJECTION.  [1]

When connect() is called for an unbound socket, we search for an
available ephemeral port.  If a bhash bucket exists for the port, we
call __inet_check_established() or __inet6_check_established() to check
if the bucket is reusable.

If reusable, we add the socket into ehash and set inet_sk(sk)->inet_num.

Later, we look up the corresponding bhash2 bucket and try to allocate
it if it does not exist.

Although it rarely occurs in real use, if the allocation fails, we must
revert the changes by check_established().  Otherwise, an unconnected
socket could illegally occupy an ehash entry.

Note that we do not put tw back into ehash because sk might have
already responded to a packet for tw and it would be better to free
tw earlier under such memory presure.

net/sched: act_mirred: use the backlog for mirred ingress

The test Davide added in commit ca22da2fbd69 (""act_mirred: use the backlog
for nested calls to mirred ingress"") hangs our testing VMs every 10 or so
runs, with the familiar tcp_v4_rcv -> tcp_v4_rcv deadlock reported by
lockdep.

The problem as previously described by Davide (see Link) is that
if we reverse flow of traffic with the redirect (egress -> ingress)
we may reach the same socket which generated the packet. And we may
still be holding its socket lock. The common solution to such deadlocks
is to put the packet in the Rx backlog, rather than run the Rx path
inline. Do that for all egress -> ingress reversals, not just once
we started to nest mirred calls.

In the past there was a concern that the backlog indirection will
lead to loss of error reporting / less accurate stats. But the current
workaround does not seem to address the issue."

arp: Prevent overflow in arp_req_get().

syzkaller reported an overflown write in arp_req_get(). [0]

When ioctl(SIOCGARP) is issued, arp_req_get() looks up an neighbour
entry and copies neigh->ha to struct arpreq.arp_ha.sa_data.

The arp_ha here is struct sockaddr, not struct sockaddr_storage, so
the sa_data buffer is just 14 bytes.

In the splat below, 2 bytes are overflown to the next int field,
arp_flags.  We initialise the field just after the memcpy(), so it's
not a problem.

However, when dev->addr_len is greater than 22 (e.g. MAX_ADDR_LEN),
arp_netmask is overwritten, which could be set as htonl(0xFFFFFFFFUL)
in arp_ioctl() before calling arp_req_get().

To avoid the overflow, let's limit the max length of memcpy().

Note that commit b5f0de6df6dc (""net: dev: Convert sa_data to flexible
array in struct sockaddr"") just silenced syzkaller.

[CAUSE]
During create_subvol(), after inserting root item for the newly created
subvolume, we would trigger btrfs_get_new_fs_root() to get the
btrfs_root of that subvolume.

The idea here is, we have preallocated an anonymous device number for
the subvolume, thus we can assign it to the new subvolume.

But there is really nothing preventing things like backref walk to read
the new subvolume.
If that happens before we call btrfs_get_new_fs_root(), the subvolume
would be read out, with a new anonymous device number assigned already.

In that case, we would trigger ASSERT(), as we really expect no one to
read out that subvolume (which is not yet accessible from the fs).
But things like backref walk is still possible to trigger the read on
the subvolume.

Thus our assumption on the ASSERT() is not correct in the first place.

[FIX]
Fix it by removing the ASSERT(), and just free the @anon_dev, reset it
to 0, and continue.

If the subvolume tree is read out by something else, it should have
already get a new anon_dev assigned thus we only need to free the
preallocated one."

This happens because we fail to write out the free space cache in one
instance, come back around and attempt to write it again.  However on
the second pass through we go to call btrfs_get_extent() on the inode to
get the extent mapping.  Because this is a new block group, and with the
free space inode we always search the commit root to avoid deadlocking
with the tree, we find nothing and return a EXTENT_MAP_HOLE for the
requested range.

This happens because the first time we try to write the space cache out
we hit an error, and on an error we drop the extent mapping.  This is
normal for normal files, but the free space cache inode is special.  We
always expect the extent map to be correct.  Thus the second time
through we end up with a bogus extent map.

Since we're deprecating this feature, the most straightforward way to
fix this is to simply skip dropping the extent map range for this failed
range.

I shortened the test by using error injection to stress the area to make
it easier to reproduce.  With this patch in place we no longer panic
with my error injection test."

drm/i915/dsc: Fix the macro that calculates DSCC_/DSCA_ PPS reg address

Commit bd077259d0a9 (""drm/i915/vdsc: Add function to read any PPS
register"") defines a new macro to calculate the DSC PPS register
addresses with PPS number as an input. This macro correctly calculates
the addresses till PPS 11 since the addresses increment by 4. So in that
case the following macro works correctly to give correct register
address:

_MMIO(_DSCA_PPS_0 + (pps) * 4)

However after PPS 11, the register address for PPS 12 increments by 12
because of RC Buffer memory allocation in between. Because of this
discontinuity in the address space, the macro calculates wrong addresses
for PPS 12 - 16 resulting into incorrect DSC PPS parameter value
read/writes causing DSC corruption.

This fixes it by correcting this macro to add the offset of 12 for PPS
>=12.

dm-crypt, dm-verity: disable tasklets

Tasklets have an inherent problem with memory corruption. The function
tasklet_action_common calls tasklet_trylock, then it calls the tasklet
callback and then it calls tasklet_unlock. If the tasklet callback frees
the structure that contains the tasklet or if it calls some code that may
free it, tasklet_unlock will write into free memory.

The commits 8e14f610159d and d9a02e016aaf try to fix it for dm-crypt, but
it is not a sufficient fix and the data corruption can still happen [1].
There is no fix for dm-verity and dm-verity will write into free memory
with every tasklet-processed bio.

There will be atomic workqueues implemented in the kernel 6.9 [2]. They
will have better interface and they will not suffer from the memory
corruption problem.

But we need something that stops the memory corruption now and that can be
backported to the stable kernels. So, I'm proposing this commit that
disables tasklets in both dm-crypt and dm-verity. This commit doesn't
remove the tasklet support, because the tasklet code will be reused when
atomic workqueues will be implemented.

powerpc/kasan: Limit KASAN thread size increase to 32KB

KASAN is seen to increase stack usage, to the point that it was reported

To avoid overflows the stack size was doubled for KASAN builds in
commit 3e8635fb2e07 (""powerpc/kasan: Force thread size increase with
KASAN"").

However with a 32KB stack size to begin with, the doubling leads to a
64KB stack, which causes build errors:

Although the asm could be reworked, in practice a 32KB stack seems
sufficient even for KASAN builds - the additional usage seems to be in
the 2-3KB range for a 64-bit KASAN build.

So only increase the stack for KASAN if the stack size is < 32KB."

parisc: Fix random data corruption from exception handler

The current exception handler implementation, which assists when accessing
user space memory, may exhibit random data corruption if the compiler decides
to use a different register than the specified register %r29 (defined in
ASM_EXCEPTIONTABLE_REG) for the error code. If the compiler choose another
register, the fault handler will nevertheless store -EFAULT into %r29 and thus
trash whatever this register is used for.
Looking at the assembly I found that this happens sometimes in emulate_ldd().

To solve the issue, the easiest solution would be if it somehow is
possible to tell the fault handler which register is used to hold the error
code. Using %0 or %1 in the inline assembly is not posssible as it will show
up as e.g. %r29 (with the ""%r"" prefix), which the GNU assembler can not
convert to an integer.

This patch takes another, better and more flexible approach:
We extend the __ex_table (which is out of the execution path) by one 32-word.
In this word we tell the compiler to insert the assembler instruction
""or %r0,%r0,%reg"", where %reg references the register which the compiler
choosed for the error return code.
In case of an access failure, the fault handler finds the __ex_table entry and
can examine the opcode. The used register is encoded in the lowest 5 bits, and
the fault handler can then store -EFAULT into this register.

Since we extend the __ex_table to 3 words we can't use the BUILDTIME_TABLE_SORT
config option any longer."

hv_netvsc: Fix race condition between netvsc_probe and netvsc_remove

In commit ac5047671758 (""hv_netvsc: Disable NAPI before closing the
VMBus channel""), napi_disable was getting called for all channels,
including all subchannels without confirming if they are enabled or not.

This caused hv_netvsc getting hung at napi_disable, when netvsc_probe()
has finished running but nvdev->subchan_work has not started yet.
netvsc_subchan_work() -> rndis_set_subchannel() has not created the
sub-channels and because of that netvsc_sc_open() is not running.
netvsc_remove() calls cancel_work_sync(&nvdev->subchan_work), for which
netvsc_subchan_work did not run.

netif_napi_add() sets the bit NAPI_STATE_SCHED because it ensures NAPI
cannot be scheduled. Then netvsc_sc_open() -> napi_enable will clear the
NAPIF_STATE_SCHED bit, so it can be scheduled. napi_disable() does the
opposite.

Now during netvsc_device_remove(), when napi_disable is called for those
subchannels, napi_disable gets stuck on infinite msleep.

This fix addresses this problem by ensuring that napi_disable() is not
getting called for non-enabled NAPI struct.
But netif_napi_del() is still necessary for these non-enabled NAPI struct
for cleanup purpose.

nilfs2: fix hang in nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers()

Syzbot reported a hang issue in migrate_pages_batch() called by mbind()
and nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() called in the log writer of nilfs2.

While migrate_pages_batch() locks a folio and waits for the writeback to
complete, the log writer thread that should bring the writeback to
completion picks up the folio being written back in
nilfs_lookup_dirty_data_buffers() that it calls for subsequent log
creation and was trying to lock the folio.  Thus causing a deadlock.

In the first place, it is unexpected that folios/pages in the middle of
writeback will be updated and become dirty.  Nilfs2 adds a checksum to
verify the validity of the log being written and uses it for recovery at
mount, so data changes during writeback are suppressed.  Since this is
broken, an unclean shutdown could potentially cause recovery to fail.

Investigation revealed that the root cause is that the wait for writeback
completion in nilfs_page_mkwrite() is conditional, and if the backing
device does not require stable writes, data may be modified without
waiting.

Fix these issues by making nilfs_page_mkwrite() wait for writeback to

return an error to mac80211.
Mac80211 was thinking that we have the station and because of that,
sta_info::uploaded was set to 1. This allowed
ieee80211_find_sta_by_ifaddr() to return a valid station object, but
that ieee80211_sta didn't have any iwl_mvm_sta object initialized and
that caused the crash mentioned earlier when we got Rx on that station."

smb: Fix regression in writes when non-standard maximum write size negotiated

The conversion to netfs in the 6.3 kernel caused a regression when
maximum write size is set by the server to an unexpected value which is
not a multiple of 4096 (similarly if the user overrides the maximum
write size by setting mount parm ""wsize"", but sets it to a value that
is not a multiple of 4096).  When negotiated write size is not a
multiple of 4096 the netfs code can skip the end of the final
page when doing large sequential writes, causing data corruption.

This section of code is being rewritten/removed due to a large
netfs change, but until that point (ie for the 6.3 kernel until now)
we can not support non-standard maximum write sizes.

Add a warning if a user specifies a wsize on mount that is not
a multiple of 4096 (and round down), also add a change where we
round down the maximum write size if the server negotiates a value
that is not a multiple of 4096 (we also have to check to make sure that
we do not round it down to zero)."

xen/events: close evtchn after mapping cleanup

shutdown_pirq and startup_pirq are not taking the
irq_mapping_update_lock because they can't due to lock inversion. Both
are called with the irq_desc->lock being taking. The lock order,
however, is first irq_mapping_update_lock and then irq_desc->lock.

This opens multiple races:
- shutdown_pirq can be interrupted by a function that allocates an event
  channel:

  CPU0                        CPU1
  shutdown_pirq {
    xen_evtchn_close(e)
                              __startup_pirq {
                                EVTCHNOP_bind_pirq
                                  -> returns just freed evtchn e
                                set_evtchn_to_irq(e, irq)
                              }
    xen_irq_info_cleanup() {
      set_evtchn_to_irq(e, -1)
    }
  }

  Assume here event channel e refers here to the same event channel
  number.
  After this race the evtchn_to_irq mapping for e is invalid (-1).

- __startup_pirq races with __unbind_from_irq in a similar way. Because
  __startup_pirq doesn't take irq_mapping_update_lock it can grab the
  evtchn that __unbind_from_irq is currently freeing and cleaning up. In
  this case even though the event channel is allocated, its mapping can
  be unset in evtchn_to_irq.

The fix is to first cleanup the mappings and then close the event
channel. In this way, when an event channel gets allocated it's
potential previous evtchn_to_irq mappings are guaranteed to be unset already.
This is also the reverse order of the allocation where first the event
channel is allocated and then the mappings are setup.

On a 5.10 kernel prior to commit 3fcdaf3d7634 (""xen/events: modify internal
[un]bind interfaces""), we hit a BUG like the following during probing of NVMe
devices. The issue is that during nvme_setup_io_queues, pci_free_irq
is called for every device which results in a call to shutdown_pirq.
With many nvme devices it's therefore likely to hit this race during
boot because there will be multiple calls to shutdown_pirq and
startup_pirq are running potentially in parallel.

wifi: cfg80211: detect stuck ECSA element in probe resp

We recently added some validation that we don't try to
connect to an AP that is currently in a channel switch
process, since that might want the channel to be quiet
or we might not be able to connect in time to hear the
switching in a beacon. This was in commit c09c4f31998b
(""wifi: mac80211: don't connect to an AP while it's in
a CSA process"").

However, we promptly got a report that this caused new
connection failures, and it turns out that the AP that
we now cannot connect to is permanently advertising an
extended channel switch announcement, even with quiet.
The AP in question was an Asus RT-AC53, with firmware
3.0.0.4.380_10760-g21a5898.

As a first step, attempt to detect that we're dealing
with such a situation, so mac80211 can use this later."

we never connect to such an AP.

Improve this situation by checking more carefully and ignoring
the ECSA if cfg80211 has previously detected the ECSA element
being stuck in the probe response.

Additionally, allow connecting to an AP that's switching to a
channel it's already using, unless it's using quiet mode. In
this case, we may just have to adjust bandwidth later. If it's
actually switching channels, it's better not to try to connect
in the middle of that."

x86/efistub: Use 1:1 file:memory mapping for PE/COFF .compat section

The .compat section is a dummy PE section that contains the address of
the 32-bit entrypoint of the 64-bit kernel image if it is bootable from
32-bit firmware (i.e., CONFIG_EFI_MIXED=y)

This section is only 8 bytes in size and is only referenced from the
loader, and so it is placed at the end of the memory view of the image,
to avoid the need for padding it to 4k, which is required for sections
appearing in the middle of the image.

Unfortunately, this violates the PE/COFF spec, and even if most EFI
loaders will work correctly (including the Tianocore reference
implementation), PE loaders do exist that reject such images, on the
basis that both the file and memory views of the file contents should be
described by the section headers in a monotonically increasing manner
without leaving any gaps.

So reorganize the sections to avoid this issue. This results in a slight
padding overhead (< 4k) which can be avoided if desired by disabling
CONFIG_EFI_MIXED (which is only needed in rare cases these days)"

EX_TYPE_UACCESS, explicitly indicating that the kernel is attempting to
access userspace memory. However, if the fixup type is EX_TYPE_DEFAULT
the only thing that is raised for an in-kernel #MC is a panic.

ex_handler_uaccess() would warn if users gave a non-canonical addresses
(with bit 63 clear) to {get, put}_user(), which was unexpected.

Therefore, commit

  b19b74bc99b1 (""x86/mm: Rework address range check in get_user() and put_user()"")

replaced _ASM_EXTABLE_UA() with _ASM_EXTABLE() for {get, put}_user()
fixups. However, the new fixup type EX_TYPE_DEFAULT results in a panic.

Commit

  6014bc27561f (""x86-64: make access_ok() independent of LAM"")

added the check gp_fault_address_ok() right before the WARN_ONCE() in
ex_handler_uaccess() to not warn about non-canonical user addresses due
to LAM.

With that in place, revert back to _ASM_EXTABLE_UA() for {get,put}_user()

arm64: entry: fix ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD

Currently the ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD workaround isn't
quite right, as it is supposed to be applied after the last explicit
memory access, but is immediately followed by an LDR.

The ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD workaround is used to
handle Cortex-A520 erratum 2966298 and Cortex-A510 erratum 3117295,
which are described in:

* https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN2444153/0600/?lang=en
* https://developer.arm.com/documentation/SDEN1873361/1600/?lang=en

In both cases the workaround is described as:

| If pagetable isolation is disabled, the context switch logic in the
| kernel can be updated to execute the following sequence on affected
| cores before exiting to EL0, and after all explicit memory accesses:
|
| 1. A non-shareable TLBI to any context and/or address, including
|    unused contexts or addresses, such as a `TLBI VALE1 Xzr`.
|
| 2. A DSB NSH to guarantee completion of the TLBI.

The important part being that the TLBI+DSB must be placed ""after all
explicit memory accesses"".

Unfortunately, as-implemented, the TLBI+DSB is immediately followed by
an LDR, as we have:

| alternative_if ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD
| 	tlbi	vale1, xzr
| 	dsb	nsh
| alternative_else_nop_endif
| alternative_if_not ARM64_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0
| 	ldr	lr, [sp, #S_LR]
| 	add	sp, sp, #PT_REGS_SIZE		// restore sp
| 	eret
| alternative_else_nop_endif
|
| [ ... KPTI exception return path ... ]

This patch fixes this by reworking the logic to place the TLBI+DSB
immediately before the ERET, after all explicit memory accesses.

The ERET is currently in a separate alternative block, and alternatives
cannot be nested. To account for this, the alternative block for
ARM64_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0 is replaced with a single alternative branch
to skip the KPTI logic, with the new shape of the logic being:

| alternative_insn ""b .L_skip_tramp_exit_\@"", nop, ARM64_UNMAP_KERNEL_AT_EL0
| 	[ ... KPTI exception return path ... ]
| .L_skip_tramp_exit_\@:
|
| 	ldr	lr, [sp, #S_LR]
| 	add	sp, sp, #PT_REGS_SIZE		// restore sp
|
| alternative_if ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_UNPRIV_LOAD
| 	tlbi	vale1, xzr
| 	dsb	nsh
| alternative_else_nop_endif
| 	eret

The new structure means that the workaround is only applied when KPTI is
not in use; this is fine as noted in the documented implications of the
erratum:

| Pagetable isolation between EL0 and higher level ELs prevents the
| issue from occurring.

... and as per the workaround description quoted above, the workaround
is only necessary ""If pagetable isolation is disabled""."

net/sched: flower: Fix chain template offload

When a qdisc is deleted from a net device the stack instructs the
underlying driver to remove its flow offload callback from the
associated filter block using the 'FLOW_BLOCK_UNBIND' command. The stack
then continues to replay the removal of the filters in the block for
this driver by iterating over the chains in the block and invoking the
'reoffload' operation of the classifier being used. In turn, the
classifier in its 'reoffload' operation prepares and emits a
'FLOW_CLS_DESTROY' command for each filter.

However, the stack does not do the same for chain templates and the
underlying driver never receives a 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_DESTROY' command when
a qdisc is deleted. This results in a memory leak [1] which can be
reproduced using [2].

Fix by introducing a 'tmplt_reoffload' operation and have the stack
invoke it with the appropriate arguments as part of the replay.
Implement the operation in the sole classifier that supports chain
templates (flower) by emitting the 'FLOW_CLS_TMPLT_{CREATE,DESTROY}'
command based on whether a flow offload callback is being bound to a
filter block or being unbound from one.

As far as I can tell, the issue happens since cited commit which
reordered tcf_block_offload_unbind() before tcf_block_flush_all_chains()
in __tcf_block_put(). The order cannot be reversed as the filter block
is expected to be freed after flushing all the chains.

For example the following code:

	int ret;

	arg.addr = 0xffffffffffff0000;
	arg.size = 0x80000000; /*2 Gb*/
	arg.flags = 0x7;
	ret = drmIoctl(fd, 0xc1186451/*amdgpu_gem_userptr_ioctl*/, &arg);
}

Due to the address and size are not valid there is a failure in
amdgpu_hmm_register->mmu_interval_notifier_insert->__mmu_interval_notifier_insert->
check_shl_overflow, but we even the amdgpu_hmm_register failure we still call
amdgpu_hmm_unregister into  amdgpu_gem_object_free which causes access to a bad address.

libceph: just wait for more data to be available on the socket

A short read may occur while reading the message footer from the
socket.  Later, when the socket is ready for another read, the
messenger invokes all read_partial_*() handlers, including
read_partial_sparse_msg_data().  The expectation is that
read_partial_sparse_msg_data() would bail, allowing the messenger to
invoke read_partial() for the footer and pick up where it left off.

However read_partial_sparse_msg_data() violates that and ends up
calling into the state machine in the OSD client.  The sparse-read
state machine assumes that it's a new op and interprets some piece of
the footer as the sparse-read header and returns bogus extents/data
length, etc.

To determine whether read_partial_sparse_msg_data() should bail, let's
reuse cursor->total_resid.  Because once it reaches to zero that means
all the extents and data have been successfully received in last read,
else it could break out when partially reading any of the extents and
data.  And then osd_sparse_read() could continue where it left off.

PM / devfreq: Synchronize devfreq_monitor_[start/stop]

There is a chance if a frequent switch of the governor
done in a loop result in timer list corruption where
timer cancel being done from two place one from
cancel_delayed_work_sync() and followed by expire_timers()
can be seen from the traces[1].

while true
do
        echo ""simple_ondemand"" > /sys/class/devfreq/1d84000.ufshc/governor
        echo ""performance"" > /sys/class/devfreq/1d84000.ufshc/governor
done

It looks to be issue with devfreq driver where
device_monitor_[start/stop] need to synchronized so that
delayed work should get corrupted while it is either
being queued or running or being cancelled.

Let's use polling flag and devfreq lock to synchronize the
queueing the timer instance twice and work data being
corrupted.

drm/amd/display: Fix disable_otg_wa logic

[Why]
When switching to another HDMI mode, we are unnecesarilly
disabling/enabling FIFO causing both HPO and DIG registers to be set at
the same time when only HPO is supposed to be set.

This can lead to a system hang the next time we change refresh rates as
there are cases when we don't disable OTG/FIFO but FIFO is enabled when
it isn't supposed to be.

[How]
Removing the enable/disable FIFO entirely."

um: time-travel: fix time corruption

In 'basic' time-travel mode (without =inf-cpu or =ext), we
still get timer interrupts. These can happen at arbitrary
points in time, i.e. while in timer_read(), which pushes
time forward just a little bit. Then, if we happen to get
the interrupt after calculating the new time to push to,
but before actually finishing that, the interrupt will set
the time to a value that's incompatible with the forward,
and we'll crash because time goes backwards when we do the
forwarding.

Fix this by reading the time_travel_time, calculating the
adjustment, and doing the adjustment all with interrupts
disabled."

thermal: intel: hfi: Add syscore callbacks for system-wide PM

The kernel allocates a memory buffer and provides its location to the
hardware, which uses it to update the HFI table. This allocation occurs
during boot and remains constant throughout runtime.

When resuming from hibernation, the restore kernel allocates a second
memory buffer and reprograms the HFI hardware with the new location as
part of a normal boot. The location of the second memory buffer may
differ from the one allocated by the image kernel.

When the restore kernel transfers control to the image kernel, its HFI
buffer becomes invalid, potentially leading to memory corruption if the
hardware writes to it (the hardware continues to use the buffer from the
restore kernel).

It is also possible that the hardware ""forgets"" the address of the memory
buffer when resuming from ""deep"" suspend. Memory corruption may also occur
in such a scenario.

To prevent the described memory corruption, disable HFI when preparing to
suspend or hibernate. Enable it when resuming.

Add syscore callbacks to handle the package of the boot CPU (packages of
non-boot CPUs are handled via CPU offline). Syscore ops always run on the
boot CPU. Additionally, HFI only needs to be disabled during ""deep"" suspend
and hibernation. Syscore ops only run in these cases.

drm/amd/display: Refactor DMCUB enter/exit idle interface

[Why]
We can hang in place trying to send commands when the DMCUB isn't
powered on.

[How]
We need to exit out of the idle state prior to sending a command,
but the process that performs the exit also invokes a command itself.

Fixing this issue involves the following:

1. Using a software state to track whether or not we need to start
   the process to exit idle or notify idle.

It's possible for the hardware to have exited an idle state without
driver knowledge, but entering one is always restricted to a driver
allow - which makes the SW state vs HW state mismatch issue purely one
of optimization, which should seldomly be hit, if at all.

2. Refactor any instances of exit/notify idle to use a single wrapper
   that maintains this SW state.

This works simialr to dc_allow_idle_optimizations, but works at the
DMCUB level and makes sure the state is marked prior to any notify/exit
idle so we don't enter an infinite loop.

3. Make sure we exit out of idle prior to sending any commands or
   waiting for DMCUB idle.

This patch takes care of 1/2. A future patch will take care of wrapping
DMCUB command submission with calls to this new interface."

[How]
Add dc_wake_and_execute_gpint() to wrap the wake, execute, sleep
sequence.

If the GPINT executes successfully then DMCUB will be put back into

MAX_ORDER is 8, the minimum value of PAGE_SIZE is 4096, the corresponding
maximum number of groups that can be allocated is:

 (PAGE_SIZE << MAX_ORDER) / sizeof(struct ext4_new_group_data) ˜ 21845

And the value that is down-aligned to the power of 2 is 16384. Therefore,
this value is defined as MAX_RESIZE_BG, and the number of groups added
each time does not exceed this value during resizing, and is added multiple
times to complete the online resizing. The difference is that the metadata
in a flex_bg may be more dispersed."

The problem appears to be caused by CPU reordering of writes issued from
__tracing_map_insert().

The check for the presence of an element with a given key in this
function is:

 val = READ_ONCE(entry->val);
 if (val && keys_match(key, val->key, map->key_size)) ...

The write of a new entry is:

 elt = get_free_elt(map);
 memcpy(elt->key, key, map->key_size);
 entry->val = elt;

The ""memcpy(elt->key, key, map->key_size);"" and ""entry->val = elt;""
stores may become visible in the reversed order on another CPU. This
second CPU might then incorrectly determine that a new key doesn't match
an already present val->key and subse

This happens because create_pending_snapshot() initializes the new root
item as a copy of the source root item. This includes the refs field,
which is 0 for a deleted subvolume. The call to btrfs_insert_root()
therefore inserts a root with refs == 0. btrfs_get_new_fs_root() then
finds the root and returns -ENOENT if refs == 0, which causes
create_pending_snapshot() to abort.

Fix it by checking the source root's refs before attempting the
snapshot, but after locking subvol_sem to avoid racing with deletion."

scsi: target: core: Avoid smp_processor_id() in preemptible code

The BUG message ""BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000]
code"" was observed for TCMU devices with kernel config DEBUG_PREEMPT.

The message was observed when blktests block/005 was run on TCMU devices
with fileio backend or user:zbc backend [1]. The commit 1130b499b4a7
(""scsi: target: tcm_loop: Use LIO wq cmd submission helper"") triggered the
symptom. The commit modified work queue to handle commands and changed
'current->nr_cpu_allowed' at smp_processor_id() call.

The message was also observed at system shutdown when TCMU devices were not
cleaned up [2]. The function smp_processor_id() was called in SCSI host
work queue for abort handling, and triggered the BUG message. This symptom
was observed regardless of the commit 1130b499b4a7 (""scsi: target:
tcm_loop: Use LIO wq cmd submission helper"").

To avoid the preemptible code check at smp_processor_id(), get CPU ID with
raw_smp_processor_id() instead. The CPU ID is used for performance
improvement then thread move to other CPU will not affect the code.

Syzbot found that the kernel generates a WARNing if the user tries to

created by pskb_copy() where the frag_list was cloned (all the skbs
in it were skb_get'ed) and shared by multiple skbs.

However, the new appended frag skb should have been only seen by the
current skb. Otherwise, it will cause use after free crashes as this
appended frag skb are seen by multiple skbs but it only got skb_get
called once.

skb_cloned skb. Li Shuang has reported quite a few crashes caused

mptcp: fix data stream corruption

Maxim reported several issues when forcing a TCP transparent proxy
to use the MPTCP protocol for the inbound connections. He also
provided a clean reproducer.

The problem boils down to 'mptcp_frag_can_collapse_to()' assuming
that only MPTCP will use the given page_frag.

If others - e.g. the plain TCP protocol - allocate page fragments,
we can end-up re-using already allocated memory for mptcp_data_frag.

Fix the issue ensuring that the to-be-expanded data fragment is
located at the current page frag end.

DMA through sysfs. This doesn't work for AMD IOMMU at the moment because

Function skb_ext_add() doesn't initialize created skb extension with any

TC_SKB_EXT originally contained only single value tc_skb_ext->chain its
users used to just assign the chain value without setting whole extension

extended with additional fields but not all users were updated to

netfilter: nf_tables: mark set as dead when unbinding anonymous set with timeout

While the rhashtable set gc runs asynchronously, a race allows it to

released from the commit path.

Mingi Cho originally reported this issue in a different path in 6.1.x
with a pipapo set with low timeouts which is not possible upstream since
7395dfacfff6 (""netfilter: nf_tables: use timestamp to check for set
element timeout"").

Fix this by setting on the dead flag for anonymous sets to skip async gc
in this case.

According to 08e4c8c5919f (""netfilter: nf_tables: mark newset as dead on

objects via workqueue, therefore, this sets on the dead flag for abort
path too."

bpf, lockdown, audit: Fix buggy SELinux lockdown permission checks

Commit 59438b46471a (""security,lockdown,selinux: implement SELinux lockdown"")
added an implementation of the locked_down LSM hook to SELinux, with the aim
to restrict which domains are allowed to perform operations that would breach
lockdown. This is indirectly also getting audit subsystem involved to report
events. The latter is problematic, as reported by Ondrej and Serhei, since it
can bring down the whole system via audit:

  1) The audit events that are triggered due to calls to security_locked_down()
     can OOM kill a machine, see below details [0].

  2) It also seems to be causing a deadlock via avc_has_perm()/slow_avc_audit()
     when trying to wake up kauditd, for example, when using trace_sched_switch()
     tracepoint, see details in [1]. Triggering this was not via some hypothetical
     corner case, but with existing tools like runqlat & runqslower from bcc, for
     example, which make use of this tracepoint. Rough call sequence goes like:

     rq_lock(rq) -> -------------------------+
       trace_sched_switch() ->               |
         bpf_prog_xyz() ->                   +-> deadlock
           selinux_lockdown() ->             |
             audit_log_end() ->              |
               wake_up_interruptible() ->    |
                 try_to_wake_up() ->         |
                   rq_lock(rq) --------------+

What's worse is that the intention of 59438b46471a to further restrict lockdown
settings for specific applications in respect to the global lockdown policy is
completely broken for BPF. The SELinux policy rule for the current lockdown check
looks something like this:

  allow <who> <who> : lockdown { <reason> };

However, this doesn't match with the 'current' task where the security_locked_down()
is executed, example: httpd does a syscall. There is a tracing program attached
to the syscall which triggers a BPF program to run, which ends up doing a
bpf_probe_read_kernel{,_str}() helper call. The selinux_lockdown() hook does
the permission check against 'current', that is, httpd in this example. httpd
has literally zero relation to this tracing program, and it would be nonsensical
having to write an SELinux policy rule against httpd to let the tracing helper
pass. The policy in this case needs to be against the entity that is installing
the BPF program. For example, if bpftrace would generate a histogram of syscall
counts by user space application:

  bpftrace -e 'tracepoint:raw_syscalls:sys_enter { @[comm] = count(); }'

bpftrace would then go and generate a BPF program from this internally. One way
of doing it [for the sake of the example] could be to call bpf_get_current_task()
helper and then access current->comm via one of bpf_probe_read_kernel{,_str}()
helpers. So the program itself has nothing to do with httpd or any other random
app doing a syscall here. The BPF program _explicitly initiated_ the lockdown
check. The allow/deny policy belongs in the context of bpftrace: meaning, you
want to grant bpftrace access to use these helpers, but other tracers on the
system like my_random_tracer _not_.

Therefore fix all three issues at the same time by taking a completely different
approach for the security_locked_down() hook, that is, move the check into the
program verification phase where we actually retrieve the BPF func proto. This
also reliably gets the task (current) that is trying to install the BPF tracing
program, e.g. bpftrace/bcc/perf/systemtap/etc, and it also fixes the OOM since
we're moving this out of the BPF helper's fast-path which can be called several
millions of times per second.

The check is then also in line with other security_locked_down() hooks in the
system where the enforcement is performed at open/load time, for example,
open_kcore() for /proc/kcore access or module_sig_check() for module signatures
just to pick f

scsi: core: Move scsi_host_busy() out of host lock for waking up EH handler

Inside scsi_eh_wakeup(), scsi_host_busy() is called & checked with host
lock every time for deciding if error handler kthread needs to be waken up.

This can be too heavy in case of recovery, such as:

 - N hardware queues

 - queue depth is M for each hardware queue

 - each scsi_host_busy() iterates over (N * M) tag/requests

If recovery is triggered in case that all requests are in-flight, each
scsi_eh_wakeup() is strictly serialized, when scsi_eh_wakeup() is called
for the last in-flight request, scsi_host_busy() has been run for (N * M -
1) times, and request has been iterated for (N*M - 1) * (N * M) times.

If both N and M are big enough, hard lockup can be triggered on acquiring
host lock, and it is observed on mpi3mr(128 hw queues, queue depth 8169).

Fix the issue by calling scsi_host_busy() outside the host lock. We don't
need the host lock for getting busy count because host the lock never
covers that.

KVM: s390: fix setting of fpc register

kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_set_fpu() allows to set the floating point control
(fpc) register of a guest cpu. The new value is tested for validity by
temporarily loading it into the fpc register.

This may lead to corruption of the fpc register of the host process:
if an interrupt happens while the value is temporarily loaded into the fpc
register, and within interrupt context floating point or vector registers
are used, the current fp/vx registers are saved with save_fpu_regs()
assuming they belong to user space and will be loaded into fp/vx registers
when returning to user space.

test_fp_ctl() restores the original user space / host process fpc register
value, however it will be discarded, when returning to user space.

In result the host process will incorrectly continue to run with the value
that was supposed to be used for a guest cpu.

Fix this by simply removing the test. There is another test right before
the SIE context is entered which will handles invalid values.

This results in a change of behaviour: invalid values will now be accepted
instead of that the ioctl fails with -EINVAL. This seems to be acceptable,
given that this interface is most likely not used anymore, and this is in
addition the same behaviour implemented with the memory mapped interface
(replace invalid values with zero) - see sync_regs() in kvm-s390.c."

sched/fair: Fix shift-out-of-bounds in load_balance()

Syzbot reported a handful of occurrences where an sd->nr_balance_failed can
grow to much higher values than one would expect.

A successful load_balance() resets it to 0; a failed one increments
it. Once it gets to sd->cache_nice_tries + 3, this *should* trigger an
active balance, which will either set it to sd->cache_nice_tries+1 or reset
it to 0. However, in case the to-be-active-balanced task is not allowed to
run on env->dst_cpu, then the increment is done without any further
modification.

This could then be repeated ad nauseam, and would explain the absurdly high
values reported by syzbot (86, 149). VincentG noted there is value in
letting sd->cache_nice_tries grow, so the shift itself should be
fixed. That means preventing:

  """"""
  If the value of the right operand is negative or is greater than or equal
  to the width of the promoted left operand, the behavior is undefined.
  """"""

Thus we need to cap the shift exponent to
  BITS_PER_TYPE(typeof(lefthand)) - 1.

hfsplus: prevent corruption in shrinking truncate

I believe there are some issues introduced by commit 31651c607151
(""hfsplus: avoid deadlock on file truncation"")

HFS+ has extent records which always contains 8 extents.  In case the
first extent record in catalog file gets full, new ones are allocated from
extents overflow file.

In case shrinking truncate happens to middle of an extent record which
locates in extents overflow file, the logic in hfsplus_file_truncate() was
changed so that call to hfs_brec_remove() is not guarded any more.

Right action would be just freeing the extents that exceed the new size
inside extent record by calling hfsplus_free_extents(), and then check if
the whole extent record should be removed.  However since the guard
(blk_cnt > start) is now after the call to hfs_brec_remove(), this has
unfortunate effect that the last matching extent record is removed
unconditionally.

To reproduce this issue, create a file which has at least 10 extents, and
then perform shrinking truncate into middle of the last extent record, so
that the number of remaining extents is not under or divisible by 8.  This
causes the last extent record (8 extents) to be removed totally instead of
truncating into middle of it.  Thus this causes corruption, and lost data.

Fix for this is simply checking if the new truncated end is below the
start of this extent record, making it safe to remove the full extent
record.  However call to hfs_brec_remove() can't be moved to it's previous
place since we're dropping ->tree_lock and it can cause a race condition
and the cached info being invalidated possibly corrupting the node data.

Another issue is related to this one.  When entering into the block
(blk_cnt > start) we are not holding the ->tree_lock.  We break out from
the loop not holding the lock, but hfs_find_exit() does unlock it.  Not
sure if it's possible for someone else to take the lock under our feet,
but it can cause hard to debug errors and premature unlocking.  Even if
there's no real risk of it, the locking should still always be kept in
balance.  Thus taking the lock now just before the check."

KVM: nVMX: Always make an attempt to map eVMCS after migration

When enlightened VMCS is in use and nested state is migrated with
vmx_get_nested_state()/vmx_set_nested_state() KVM can't map evmcs
page right away: evmcs gpa is not 'struct kvm_vmx_nested_state_hdr'
and we can't read it from VP assist page because userspace may decide
to restore HV_X64_MSR_VP_ASSIST_PAGE after restoring nested state
(and QEMU, for example, does exactly that). To make sure eVMCS is
mapped /vmx_set_nested_state() raises KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES
request.

Commit f2c7ef3ba955 (""KVM: nSVM: cancel KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES
on nested vmexit"") added KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES clearing to
nested_vmx_vmexit() to make sure MSR permission bitmap is not switched
when an immediate exit from L2 to L1 happens right after migration (caused
by a pending event, for example). Unfortunately, in the exact same
situation we still need to have eVMCS mapped so
nested_sync_vmcs12_to_shadow() reflects changes in VMCS12 to eVMCS.

As a band-aid, restore nested_get_evmcs_page() when clearing
KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES in nested_vmx_vmexit(). The 'fix' is far
from being ideal as we can't easily propagate possible failures and even if
we could, this is most likely already too late to do so. The whole
'KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES' idea for mapping eVMCS after migration
seems to be fragile as we diverge too much from the 'native' path when
vmptr loading happens on vmx_set_nested_state()."

A simple reproducer looks like:
	echo 'p:myprobe sys_read fd=%a0 buf=%a1 count=%a2' > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/kprobe_events
	echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/kprobes/myprobe/enable
	cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace

Here's what happens to hit that BUG_ON():

1) After installing kprobe at entry of sys_read, the first instruction
   is replaced by 'ebreak' instruction on riscv64 platform.

2) Once kernel reach the 'ebreak' instruction at the entry of sys_read,
   it trap into the riscv breakpoint handler, where it do something to
   setup for coming single-step of origin instruction, including backup
   the 'sstatus' in pt_regs, followed by disable interrupt during single
   stepping via clear 'SIE' bit of 'sstatus' in pt_regs.

3) Then kernel restore to the instruction slot contains two instructions,
   one is original instruction at entry of sys_read, the other is 'ebreak'.
   Here it trigger a 'Instruction page fault' exception (value at 'scause'
   is '0xc'), if PF is not filled into PageTabe for that slot yet.

4) Again kernel trap into page fault exception handler, where it choose
   different policy according to the state of running kprobe. Because
   afte 2) the state is KPROBE_HIT_SS, so kernel reset the current kp

RHSA-2024:1674,N/A,CVE-2024-1635,UNKNOWN,N/A,"A vulnerability was found in Undertow. This vulnerability impacts a server that supports the wildfly-http-client protocol. Whenever a malicious user opens and closes a connection with the HTTP port of the server and then closes the connection immediately, the server will end with both memory and open file limits exhausted at some point, depending on the amount of memory available. 

At HTTP upgrade to remoting, the WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit leaks connections if RemotingConnection is closed by Remoting ServerConnectionOpenListener. Because the remoting connection originates in Undertow as part of the HTTP upgrade, there is an external layer to the remoting connection. This connection is unaware of the outermost layer when closing the connection during the connection opening procedure. Hence, the Undertow WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit is not notified of the closed connection in this scenario. Because WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit creates a timeout task, the whole dependency tree leaks via that task, which is added to XNIO WorkerThread. So, the workerThread points to the Undertow conduit, which contains the connections and causes the leak."

http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/05/30/1,CWE-770,CVE-2023-2650,MEDIUM,6.5,"Issue summary: Processing some specially crafted ASN.1 object identifiers or
data containing them may be very slow.

Impact summary: Applications that use OBJ_obj2txt() directly, or use any of
the OpenSSL subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS with no message
size limit may experience notable to very long delays when processing those
messages, which may lead to a Denial of Service.

An OBJECT IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers - sub-identifiers -
most of which have no size limit.  OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate
an ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL
type ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the
sub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by
periods.

When one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large
(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds
of KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long
time.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of the
sub-identifiers in bytes (*).

With OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /
identifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECT
IDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching
algorithms.

Such OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure
AlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify
what cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or
decrypt, or digest passed data.

Applications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are
affected, with any version of OpenSSL.  If the use is for the mere purpose
of display, the severity is considered low.

In OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,
CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS.  It also impacts anything that processes X.509
certificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.

The impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a
100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.  Additionally, this only
impacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client
authentication.

In OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,
such as X.509 certificates.  This is assumed to not happen in such a way
that it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered
not affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,
and the severity is therefore considered low."

inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but
the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type
of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by
the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an
ASN1_STRING.

When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the
X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass
arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or
enact a denial of service. In most cases, the attack requires the attacker to
provide both the certificate chain and CRL, neither of which need to have a
valid signature. If the attacker only controls one of these inputs, the other
input must already contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which
is uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect
applications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs
over a network."

decryption. The vulnerability affects all RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5,
RSA-OEAP and RSASVE.

For example, in a TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an
encrypted pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a
genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw to send
trial messages to the server and record the time taken to process them. After a
sufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master
secret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the
application data sent over that connection."
